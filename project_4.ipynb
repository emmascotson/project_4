I am going to my dads soon and that also makes me anxious because I am afraid that I am not in the mental state to go there and I want to stay at my moms but he really is not happy when I do that. Anyway when she complains or is feeling bad I comfort her and I have never raised my voice at her even when frustrated. When she thinks I disagree with her she raises her voice, I have to talk about what she wants to in general right now because she gets impatient easily. I feel like vomiting because she also has so many redeeming factors but I do not want to lose her as a friend.\n",

Month later he still do not talk to me and he and my mother started fighting for the first time in the relationship. Me and my mother honestly do not know what to do, he just ignores me. I even told him that I do not date that guy(even though I date him) and he did not even react to it.\n",

He wanted to talk about my anxiety. He said he could run some more tests, but he did not think it would help.\n",

I have googled and realised how serious it can be and now I am terrified but scared to go doctor. What do I do I am not calling police and I am not going to any hospital. I will go to doctor if they are sensitive about it\n",

I used to be a very soft person, and I hope I am still kind, but now I am quicker to anger, and I do not want to become an abuser. Basically... was I abused? Does that sound like something an abused person would say? I feel like I have the symptoms of PTSD.\n",
      "Statement 20: I really do not know what to do about this, and I am wondering if I am even able to get over this fear. A traumatic experience compounded it in me as a kid, and I have been experiencing it for so long that it feels like second nature. It is lkkely so ingrained with me that therapy will not do much good. I need some help. If anyone can offer some, feel free.\n",

I spent a ton on gas and now money is tight.\n",

I have tried asking her about it and genuinely understanding why she feels this way about it but she cannot seem to describe it rationally, saying that it is a gut feeling that she gets that legitimately bothers her and gives her anxiety. She seemed very distressed talking about it and was almost at the poiint of tears saying that she wishes she knew why it bothers her so much but it does and she cannot help it no matter how much she thinks about it or how much I try to explain it to her.

I been there for a month but i am still very nervous around my peers and teachers. I know my teacher and the tutor there get nervous/uncomfortable around me, lately they have not been talking to me much or coming up to me especially the tutor to ask if I need help  which they did before, my anxiety has gotten worse and I probably look more visibly uncomfortable than ever so that why they have barely asked if I needed help or said much to me ha! yet  seem more at ease with other people.\n",
      "Statement 42: I know this may seem like a small thing, but to someone with these problems, it is a huge deal and to be at a store where you do not feel \"safe\" around your managers and you cannot talk with them and grow as an employee, what is the point of continuing to work there? So I luckily got them to put me on 3rd shift. Minimal contact and I still get to work for the company. As I did mention, I have been struggling lately with some things: being slow with completing tasks on the work list is the biggest issue I believe. I am not sure why I am slow, in the past a supervisor has said \"Yes you are slow, but you are thorough.\"\n",

      "Statement 46: When I was a kid, I suffered a kind of unlikely injury that basically ruined me mentally, and it seems like I just CAN NOT get away from it, because it is such cheap gory shock value that everyone uses it when they need cheap gory shock value. And if I am not mentally prepared to see it I have a panic attack or just start crying. A fucking jokey homebrew cursed item on r/DND did that to me today, and I hate that my trauma is so bad that I have to stay guarded even when I am just reading a funny thread about my favorite hobby.

I have been suffering from poor mental health for over 10 years and I am about to turn 26 next week and I feel so ashamed for how serious my negative thoughts are. Covid was a hard transition especially having moved to a new city a few months before everything started locking down, but now I am here and settled and I have a loving partner, a great connection to their family, a really fun job and I finished my degree. But when I stop and look around I feel like nothing will ever be good enough for me and I will never be good enough, I will always have skin problems and bad teeth and acne. I will never be the artist I used to be (I have a Bachelor in fine art) because I do not have the same drive or passionate that I used to have for it. I will never have the career I built my entire plan around because I am losing my interest in art. I will never have the relationship with my family that I want because I could not stand to stay in my hometown. All I can feel is this tornado of my failures swirling around me all the damn time. It just seems that no matter how many positives come my way they do not last long enough to out weight the negatives.

      "Statement 8: Since I began seeing a therapist 5 months ago I have realised the thought of being happy genuinely terrifies me, and I do not even really know why. I think its probably caused by multiple things. If I had to guess, I think I just do not feel like I deserve to be happy. I have hated myself for so long that maybe I have found comfort in my misery, like its my punishment or something. And in a related way, I think I am scared of my happiness being selfish. Having been miserable for so long, I think Id feel like a selfish asshole if I suddenly got over my issues and starting liking life when I know there is countless people in the world still feeling how I did. And furthermore, its only in the last while have I really begun to take my problems seriously and have been trying to be more sympathetic to myself, but even now with all the shit I am going through its like I can still barely take care of myself. And its like I am afraid of losing the various anxiety issues and what not that make me miserable, because if I lose only them and not my self-hating mindset, Ill have even less reason to sympathise with myself. Ill be some privileged selfish asshole and be even harder on myself than I have ever been.Lastly, I think I am just afraid of the thought of living in general. Death just seems soo simple and peaceful, and I think I have become fixated on the idea of dying. Having been miserable for so many years I think the idea of any more life terrifies me. because even if I did make an amazing recovery, Ill still get new problems, which could be just as bad or worse, and I could also relapse and redevelop all my anxiety and insecurity issues. In fact I have before, in 2018 I made huge strides and then in 2019 it all turned to shit again. And a lot of it was because I had one panic attack in front of an entire class in school, in front of most of the new friends Id made in 2018 who did not know I was an insecure, anxiety ridden loser with no friends before I met them. It pretty much shattered any progress I had made, and thereafter I had multiple panic attacks in school, making it even worse.Those are my interpretations anyway. Whenever I feel like I am making any progress on myself it sends waves of panic through me. I hate it so much, and I wish to fuck I knew what was causing it, because these are all good guesses but I still do not know if that is all there is to it. I am genuinely terrified of being happy and I do not even really know why\n",
      "Statement 9: Did your depression start after a time of serious stress/anxiety? If so, this may be why you feel so disconnected. After times of intense stress, where we do not give ourselves any leeway or breaks, our body naturally will downregulate hormones to essentially force us to stop what were doing. So we may have super high levels of glutamate and norepinepherine keeping us in a stress response, but low levels of dopamine keeping us in a depression, and the high amount of anxiety neurotransmitters because us to feel both depressed and depersonalized (freeze response) If you feel disconnected from reality this may be why\n",

But i hate it, i hate that I am getting better, i feel embarrassed whenever i catch myself doing something not depressing, like taking a walk, laughing, or doing stuff by my own will. And i feel SO SO selfish, i was given immense support from everyone, my mum has spent so so much time and money on therapists, psychiatrists, pills, etc; she is suffered more than anyone else, even more than me since i seem to enjoy being depressed. she is the happiest she is been in months since she can tell I am in a better mood and she is the only reason i have not \"tried harder\" to get worse, but i do not know how long i can keep it going.Something in me just wants me to maybe stop taking my meds without letting her know, get a new self destructive habit, and go back to the old me that did not leave his bed in days and could not keep a conversation for more than 2 minutes, i really miss it.I am going back to school in a couple of months (i dropped out), i started driving lessons yesterday, I am eating better, sleeping better, I am starting to live and behave like a regular person but i cannot handle it, it makes me feel bad, gross, EMBARRASSED, very embarrassed, and its just a cycle of:I am ok this makes me depressed I am ok again this makes me depressed etc.I do not know what to do, I am not even sure why i am even writing this since I will probably end up ignoring whatever help or advice i get, but i guess i needed to vent, thanks for reading and as always sorry for my english how can i be happy about getting better??\n",

I told her that I could not do this with her because I am dealing with so much shit in my head that it is not fair to her. She said she wanted to be there for me and I shut her down.

What if I am the piece of shit suicidal asshole that I was before? I am scared to put anyone through that. I kept making up excuses for why this was not going to work out.

      "Statement 12: Not because of death, but because she wanted to get away.I have been depressed for over 10 years and maybe this is the lowest point I have ever been to.The last few days it seems like there is been an invisible force squeezing my chest all the time. I can barely eat. I spent 48 hours with only 1 sandwich in my stomach and after that I have forced myself to eat just to be able to get drunk after I get home from work just so the time goes by quickly and I do not feel this damn pain.She was my last friend. I am completely alone now.Losing people is always a disgrace to me, but ok. I have known this friend for 6 years, and even though we had a few periods without talking, we were doing well for almost 2 years, we never even had a fight until last week.Turns out I was pretty drunk and I ended up insisting on telling her that she did not really care about me and how I was a nobody to her. I really insisted on it, because I was drunk and could not even think straight, although she said clearly that she did care.Turns out she was hurt and does not want to talk to me anymore.She was the only person who really mattered and it made me want to keep living, I did not want to bring her pain.I tried to apologize, tried to ask him to understand and forgive me, but to no avail.The worst thing is that I did not even want to attack her the way I did, it is very easy for me to think that someone does not like me, after all I myself think I am rubbish and in no way worthy of any love.I did not even sleep the night that happened. I spent the whole night thinking about how I could kill myself.what is the fucking point on living if my life is a piece of thrash, and I feel bad absolutely all the time? I suck at everything and have no friends to have fun with. The ones I had I ruined it.

      "Statement 14: I have felt this way for so long I have always assumed it was normal- not so much that I was necessarily sad, but more often just numb? Like I never really feel joy or excitement, although occasionally (I distinctly remember the occasions) I have noticeable sense of peace that cuts through my general sense of heaviness. I am not sure if this depression, and I have not wanted to face it or label myself as such and be forced to deal with the reality of it if it is. I think I am having a hard time differentiating being depressed due to an internal chemical imbalance that needs to be reconciled, or just having a natural reaction to the state of the world or events (previous abuse, climate change, corruption, realizing you likely will not grow up to be what you thought you would be, the passage of time and loss of loved ones etc), or if that is a distinction that even matters?

I finally got the courage to go through my phone and try to erase the photos of the cat. I just cannot do it. I have spent an hour going through the gallery and snap chat. I have just set them to hidden. It hurts far too much. I have been suffering through depression after realizing what I had let go, what I had lost. My little family.

I am trying so hard to heal, but it hurts thinking ill need to forget our kitten.Does anyone else have any of advice for this? It really reopened a wound that was starting to heal.

      "Statement 17: Not a day goes by that I do not break down in tears at some point. 2021 has been the worst. Lost my job, my Aunt, and my stepfather. Now I am I am anxiously awaiting the results from a chest x-ray. My nerves are shot, I am stressed, I am struggling to pay my bills, keep my car on the road, still trying to figure out how I am going to afford the new tires I need while not missing a payment. My credit card has been living about $100 away from maxed for the last few months. I am starting to think everything would just be better if I did have lung cancer, then when I am gone I can stop worrying about money, and happiness, and I will not be such a burden on my family.My wife and I have talked about what is going on, but I have kept a lot of it from her, she sees me crying and does her best to ignore me. I am sure she resents me for being such a useless waste of space. When I am gone she will be able to find someone she can actually be happy with, guilt free.I just, I do not know, I guess I just needed to say it, not expecting advice, or help, just wanted to get some of these ramblings out of my head. Feels like I am all alone in this\n",

      "Statement 19: I have not seen my 7 year old daughter in a couple of months because she moved across the country with her mom, and it has literally been killing me. My mind was telling me our relationship was damaged forever because of this. She is the only bright spot in my entire life. I have just been alternating between drinking and crying, mostly.Today we connected in an online game and had a great time, we are hopefully going to be playing regularly from now on and I will get to talk to her and bond with her through this. it is a pretty basic online game for kids but the first thing she did when she met my avatar was to shrink her own avatar into a little baby and jump on my shoulders like she did when she was a toddler in real life. I literally she would tears.I have also agreed with her mom to fly over there and spend a week or so with them soon.My life has been just a black hole for many weeks now and it is so incredibly refreshing to poke your head above the water and see at least a glimmer of hope and sunshine. She does not deserve to lose her dad and I now have new motivation to push on and try to get better.If a terminal case like me can do it, so can you, hopefully. My daughter just pulled me out of a black pit of despair\n",
      "Statement 20: I cannot seem to go a couple of months without self-sabotaging myself. I do not know what comes first the depression or the self-sabotage but they work hand in hand to make me absolutely miserable. For the first time in two years I am considering going back to therapy because I just cannot live like this anymore. I cannot keep repeatedly, just making things unreasonably hard for myself. I deserve happiness and a chance at success just as much as anyone else. I just have to figure out a way to actually believe that, to put my words into thought and action. Self-sabotage\n",
      "Statement 21: I cannot fucking feel a single fucking thing man . I bottle up every feeling and I am so far away from everyone in my life . I have no friends or anyone I can talk to , I feel like shit right this now , I do not want anything in life , I do not want to grow old , travel , make friends or whatever the fuck everyone says we should live for . I just want to end it , I wish I died in my sleep , everyday I wake up I feel shock and sadness . I did not choose to be born so why do I have to suffer for people who do not give a fuck about me . oh god !! just kill me nowMusic used to make me feel better ( it was the only thing ) , but now even music does nothing . I cannot tell anyone about how I feel , I feel stuck I cannot take this anymore . My parents think that I am very lazy and stupid so anything I tell them would be because I am m lazy . Like I told my mom n dad about how I do not find anything interest while talking about career and they said it is because I am lazy and stupid that I think too highly of myself and that I am overconfident .They also said that I am useless and would not accomplish anything in life . when actually I have low self-esteem and zero self-confidence . how am I supposed to tell them about my depression that I have got because of neglect and abuse from them in childhood . Like I tell them that I do not feel like doing anything , then they would just say it is because I am lazy , you do not want to do this then you are fucking lazy and stupid \"I just want to die in my sleep , that is the only thing I want . I feel so alone , I wish I had someone to support me emotionally The worst thing about all this is being alone\n",

      "Statement 24: I am only 21. But everyone around me just tells me that I always act so serious and sometimes even dress too conservatively for my age. It.. honestly hurts my feelings. I grew up in an environment where I had so much pressure put on to me to take abuse and not complain about it, and learn to do everything on my own. I am not claiming to be more mature then people my own age but I am just tired of people making fun of me for not being more \"fun\" i do not know, it seems something dumb to complain about but it just makes me feel sad today. I get told I act and look like an old person\n",
      "Statement 25: Yeah, this is a question I have been chewing on for a long time. I have been in the depths before, as I know you all have, too, but even in those deepest depressive periods, I still wonder how I know for certain that what I am experiencing is depression. It being of the subjective mind, it seems like depression does not have strict dimensions or even definitions. it is hard to pin down and say for sure, one way or another, \"I am depressed.\" This has been an obstacle for me. Trying to take it seriously. I doubt that what I have is depression. I doubt my own ability to objectively judge this. I doubt my problems are problems at all and this just makes me feel selfish and kind of like a loser that has to fake a mood disorder to get along in the world. The ambiguous nature of depression, other mood disorders, and the feeling mind alone is enough reasonable doubt to because even more suffering in me, like depression that is accompanied by a feeling of guilt and self-deprecation.Is this normal? Part of depression's deception? Or are there ways to draw a line near-ish the middle between depressed and not depressed? We can do it to a very fine degree with physiological illnesses. Surely we could do the same for the mind, but are we there yet? How do you know for certain that depression is \"depression\"? I invite you to share your information and opinions.\n",
      "Statement 26: If you could understand, maybe you would see why I am so angry, so hurt, so destroyed. I know from your perspective, maybe you see someone who is hurting, maybe you see someone who needs help.&amp;#x200B;But if you could look beyond my eyes, behind my face. The constant struggle to just be alright and it feels like you are completely alone because you actually are. Alone in this desolate wasteland with crumpled buildings, decimated roadways and highways. &amp;#x200B;Twisted metal signs, relics of the past. With old directions guiding to better places than here. The ghosts of yesterday yelling out from the corridors of collapsed buildings as the wind whistle through the burned out city. The sun glaring down as dark clouds approach, gusts of wind kicking up large plumes of dust in the distance, heading for the city as lightning begins to strike and bombs begin to drop.&amp;#x200B;Within a moment you are surrounded by flashes of memories all over, all around you and in the winds you can hear the faint voices, some screaming, some crying, some are my own voice filled with regret and sorrow and loss.&amp;#x200B;The flashes are so intense that the images of memories begin to bleed together as you see my life unfold in bits and pieces and for a moment, just a brief second, you see me for who I really am but I whisp away into the surrounding debris just as quick as you can blink. As though it were just a ghost, just a projection of all the things I wished I could ever be. Strewn to the wind and shattered into a million pieces as you look onward trying to make sure you were not just imagining things. &amp;#x200B;The storm still flickering lightning and gunfire sounds in the fractured buildings echo around you as all sunlight fades and just as quickly as it came, the storm has passed.&amp;#x200B;you are left still wondering if everything you saw was real or not. That image of me, the forgotten dreams, the screams. How much was real? How much was just your mind trying to put the pieces together? &amp;#x200B;All these questions and doubts, like the particles of dust now drifting further away. Like a candy wrapper caught in the wind, the idea of ever knowing dies alongside the winds as they begin to settle and the sun blares bright again.&amp;#x200B;You put your hand above your eyes to shade them from the sun as you look to the sky in some hope if seeing more storm clouds. They say every cloud has a silver lining but none of these clouds seem to be anything but black, darkness, harsh. &amp;#x200B;Until you realize that you do not have to be here and your sight zooms out, slowly revealing my eyes and the pain they hide as you travel back behind your own eyes and see this figure in front of you, torn by war and so much pain. Not quite human but the figure tries.&amp;#x200B;Just as quickly as that image popped up during the storm then dissipated, the notion of who this creature is in front of you begins to blur. A hollowed out she will of all the grand things that could have been. &amp;#x200B;It is then, I think, you would begin to understand that there is nothing left here in front of you worth salvaging and so it would just be easier, simpler, to walk away.

      "Statement 29: I have a close friend who has suffered from periods of depression for years. she is been doing well for the last year, but for the past month has clearly been struggling. she is lonely and does not have anyone else in her life with whom to talk.When we do talk, she has been dropping obvious signs that she is aware that she is become depressed, but when I try to push her to go to counseling, she gets annoyed and wants to change the subject. She admits that she should go, but has no motivation to physically go. And she also has doubts that it would actually help based on past experiences.My question is, how hard should I push her to get help? Should I keep bringing it up even when she says she does not want to talk about it? Should I tell her that I will not talk to her anymore if she does not go? Or should I give in, ignore her depression, and only talk about light topics.. maybe at least providing her social stimulus and relief from her own thoughts? How much pressure to apply to a friend to get help?\n",

      "Statement 32: I have been reaching out for help. I do EVERYTHING that I am told to help me feel better.Well today I called a place about the sexual abuse I went through as a kid. A charity that gives therapy to people who have gone through that.Well. Because I was not raped, it is not deemed bad enough. I was simply molested for 2 years by a neighbor as a kid so they do not think I can get help from them.I was referred to this place by a NHS mental health team who keep referring to these places. One place will tell me I am too severe to help. And now, this place says what happened was not bad enough. I was not even abused the right way. Even my abuse was done wrong.Which is the SECOND time I have heard it this week, about TWO different types of abuse. And then people have the cheek to ask me why I am so miserable. I am literally asking for help and doing all the rubbish I am told to do, and yet here we are.Damn. Just damn.(please no \"it gets better\".

      "Statement 37: 19 years old, male, from the Philippines. The lockdown here has been going on for 2 years and more now. It completely sucks here. Not only the government, but also the parenting style and community. My parents are giant narcissist, gaslighting bastards, apathetic, scapegoating, victim blaming, and abusive people. I grew up as a kid being parentified by my mom, while experiencing how my dad openly cheated on my mom while wasting the money we have. I did not feel like I grew with a father because he never tried to form an emotional connection with me. When he does, it will be him giving something while saying he worked his ass of for it so we should be grateful for it. He has forever glorified himself having a job, and he will use it in any arguments we had; \"I am the one who has the job, who feeds you, and who gives you everything. Be fucking grateful!\" in his words. I would be beaten up by him with a belt as a kid so it has left me traumatized by flinching at anything that is loud, surprising, or both. He has not changed from my childhood until now, except it has only gotten worse as time goes on. He has endlessly made me hate him with no possible resolutions. Calling me a failure, useless, good-for-nothing, and disgrace of a son does not help at all. He is the reason why I despise cheating, abusive, and manipulative people with a passion. His god complex shows to everyone else. It does not help that he is a cop so his temper is extremely bad. He has a fragile ego that will automatically collapse when told he is wrong or disagreed with. He also thinks he is doing our pets a favour by caging and leashing them their entire lives. he is truly an abusive piece of shit that does not deserve a family of his own. he is a manchild that accidentally had children.As for my mother, she is the epitome of gaslighting, victim blaming, and narcissism. You literally cannot talk to her without her taking it personally. Like my horrible father, she also thinks the world revolves around her. This is the person who made me go through parentification as a fucking 6 year old. Until now, I have been her downpour of traumas, pain, bad memories, and rants. I am literally exhausted from everything because of this. And I HAVE to listen to her or else everything turns bad; she manipulates my father to teach me a lesson. She also believes she cannot be wrong. She strongly believes feng shui, the supernatural, superstition, and the occult. She has made our entire lives revolve around superstition. I have been gaslighted by her for who knows how much; I do not even know if my feelings are valid anymore. She would try to have an emotional connection with me, but she would just make it about herself after. Literally goes and minimizes my experiences just because she thinks she had it worse. If I have not said it before, these two are very religious. They would rather pray and complain instead of doing something. They are fanatics of the horrible president we have, and they think everyone should respect them.As their child, I am riddled with face and body acne with no help at all to relieve it; father had extreme face acne, mom has extreme body acne but no help from them. Instead, I am called out for being careless about my body and face by both of them for years. They also told me that it will just go away anyway \"like theirs\", so no medicine is needed. Due to it, I experienced a lot of bullying in my highschool years because of my acne. I could not form proper connections with others and often dressed weirdly to hide my body. I was called the \"Pimple King\" by my classmates; I wanted to kill myself so much from it because I had NO ONE to talk to about it.Fast forward to now, I have fought and kind of got some freedom, but here I am again wanting to fucking die. I had already wanted to die from my highschool daysabout 6 yearscontinuously. I had attempts but none worked. I am doing everything in the house, yet I am called a fucking failure yet again by my piece of shit father for something I did not do; our cat accidentally unplugged the doorbell ringer, which my father uses to call us when he needs us for something, in our room. When he realized there was not any doorbell noises, he checked it out and saw it was unplugged. He called me a failure for it because \"I do not care about anything and do not have a sense for anything\". These days, I cannot find anything enjoyable, interesting, or fun anymore. I just want to die. I am trying to find something to do, but my brain just rings out \"what is the point?\" and I stop. I am just in bed right now wanting to fucking die. Someone take my life please. Please. [LONG POST] Someone kill me please\n",

      "Statement 39: I have a good life if you were to look at me from the outside, but I am rarely ever happy. I have noticed lately, that when I am on social media and see something not ideal or bad happen to someone (unplanned pregnancy, breakups, etc.) I get a good feeling. Of course, there are some instances where I am happy for family members and friends who have positive things happen to them, but if its someone who has either ignored me (especially if the opposite sex), I get an especiallyyy good feeling when I see bad shit happen to them. I really want to work on this, but it is not something that I have dealt with much beforeand it makes me feel like just a bad person at the end of the day. Any thoughts or similar experiences dealing with this? Thanks. Is this Normal?\n",
      "Statement 40: I finally got my depression well under control at the end of this last year. I was managing an exercise routine, cooking lots of healthy and fun meals instead if junk food, spending more quality time with my family, enjoying hobbies again, thriving in school, and managing a self care and hygiene routine (which was always one of my big struggles).I felt like I finally got things under control but I made a big mistake that is sent everything crashing down. I took on extra responsibility and I put too much on my plate. I would rather not elaborate on what it was, but now I feel like I have no time for myself so all of my routine went out the window. I had to do a late withdraw from my last 2 college courses when I had maintained a 3.9 prior. I do not shower or brush my teeth for days at a time, I find myself binge eating and falling back into restrictive eating disorder habits, I only really look forward to eating and getting in bed every night. The Fall semester is set to begin and I do not even think I will be able to do it. If I am lucky I might slide by and pass but I am going to suffer even more with that on my plate too. Why the fuck cannot I be a functioning person? Sometimes I want to move away from my family and just let myself self destruct to my hearts content. I feel like I live to eat and sleep again\n",

      "Statement 43: A week ago my overseas boyfriend of 6 years went to prison. This means no contact for 18 months for us. I Do Not Know how I have coped honestly. there is been days where I do not feel like living and are never ending. I am young I am 17 and hes 19, but this is the man I want to spend the rest of my life with. We are not able to call due to me not being 18 yet and I cannot go over seas due to covid an financial situations atm. I knew it would be hard but I never thought it would be this hard. I have started sleeping all day, not eating, falling behind on class work and constantly crying/panic attacks. I miss him so fucking much every single day, and dread the 17 months ahead of us. there is a possibility he could get out in 12 but I do not want to get my hopes up. I am so grateful it did not hit the 2 year mark or was not a sentence like 5 years but its still so hard. It constantly feels like I do not want to live anymore but I am trying hard to hold on for him. have not felt this pain in a while. Heart ache more like heart attack.\n",
      "Statement 44: Quick background; I suffered social anxiety for most of my 20's and went in and out of depression throughout the years. I am now 31 with no friends, just a boyfriend and all my family who I barely get along with anyway live in another state. Over the last few years I have learnt to be ok with feeling lonely and being by myself. I have learnt to enjoy my own company and that is great and all but I am still friendless. I also went through a horrible year in 2019 where I went numb to something that was happening in my relationship so I would not \"feel\" so much kind of like depersonalization/derealization. Things have gotten better but the numbness has remained. I am not sure how to explain it properly but I do not have anything in my life that is thrilling or exciting to me nor do I care to seek this out. Most people have a vice like shopping, gambling, some sort of sport or activity that gives them a rush. I used to want to travel, I thought maybe that could fill my time or get me excited but even though I have the money and could travel (once out of lockdown), I just do not care for it anymore. it is like, I cannot take the memories when I die so what is the point? I could sit in my lounge room and street view places in Canada for example so once again, what is the point?All I do these days is work, come home, click around on some sites and do it all again the next day. I barely talk to anyone online. My relationship is boring and stale and even though we could spice it up, sometimes I just do not care to. I love my boyfriend but I want someone else to talk to and hang out with. I almost have no reaction to things. If I won a million dollars or even 5, I think my reaction honestly would be \"meh\". Everyone my age is either having kids, married or have successful careers. I have never chased success so I really do not care to climb the career ladder or chase money. None of that matters to me. I am not sure what does. I cannot help but feel as if I am wasting my life away. Sometimes I wish I could have a crazy life. Sometimes I get the urge to do something so out of character to shock myself. To get that thrill. To feel excitement.God, I am so utterly bored with my life. I feel numb about most things. I feel very little excitement or thrill in life.\n",

      "Statement 46: I do not know what happened. Over the course of one night I went from optimistic to questioning my reality. I am a 27M and it seemed like I got under eye wrinkles within a night. I do not know if I did not realise it before but I certainly did the morning after and the revelation hit me like a bus. I look old. Older than a 27 year old. I am single, I have no career, no degree, no money and have nothing going on in my life. But the odd thing was before that night I was still hopeful about things turning around in my life. But as soon as I saw my wrinkles that hope just seemed to vanish into the creases under my eyes. I realised I was no longer young and the thought of getting old alone is scary. Finding a partner was hard enough but this will only make it harder. The thought of aging is depressing me.\n",
      "Statement 47: tw talk about eating disorder further downHi, sorry for long post and bad formatting. I do not know who to ask this as I am on a long waiting list for a psychologist and have no one else to talk to.I have always had problems with breakfast, mostly because I have trouble waking up and am so tired that the thought of food makes me nauseous. Before work (I am currently on sick leave) I used to force down a sandwich only because I know I faint easily. Work also helped me maintain a somewhat proper meal schedule as I had designated lunch and snack breaks, and I always had an appetite right after work.Now when I have been been home several months, eating is a massive problem. Getting up earlier than 2pm is a huge but rare success but even if I do I just do not feel like eating for hours, despite feeling so hungry my stomach hurts and my head spins. I just do not crave anything and I try to drown the hunger with water and cigarettes and occasionally save myself from fainting by eating dextrose.This results in me lying around like a zombie for hours, not having the energy to do anything, until I feel too weak to make even a sandwich without having to sit down. Basically, during daytime, I HATE eating. I wish humans did not HAVE to eat and could survive off water.But then in the evening, I often find the cravings wash over me. Not only do I tend to eat unhealthy to begin with because I do not have the energy to cook (for example I often just have microwave food or frozen pizza), but at night while watching shows or playing games I feel some kind of NEED to have something. Sometimes cigarettes and tea works, but often the cravings are too strong. It can be anything I have lying around, like crisps, chocolate, nuts, anything. Sometimes it feels like a proper craving but sometimes it feels like I just have to occupy my hands and mouth. Not giving into this often results in nail biting instead, or even worse pulling at my toenails until they bleed (gross i know, but I physically cannot stop and have not been able to show my feet to anyone throughout my life). Giving into the cravings on the other hand makes me feel disgusting, like a grotesque emotional meat machine that keeps eating just for the sake of eating. I feel disgusted by the warm feeling I got after eating those tasty donuts, like how I sometimes feel disgusted after spending money on some useless expensive shit I do not really need but that gave me happiness for one small moment. It makes me feel materialistic but like, with food, if that makes any sense.Now I know the lack of food during the day probably is a big reason for the nocturnal cravings. But it is so hard forcing myself to eat when my appetite is not there, let alone cook proper meals. I am also very conscious about my body and feel like shit knowing that I have put on some weight in recent years, even though I KNOW deep inside that no one cares about that and that weight should not define my attractiveness. But despite this, I have never had an ED. And despite having somewhat ED-like thoughts about food, this feels like mainly a problem with appetite related to my depression and apathetic tendencies. I know that if I could just pull myself together, I could have somewhat healthy eating habits.My past therapist kept nagging me about meal planning but even when I am grocery shopping I cannot for the love of god come up with any ingredients to buy, despite being kind of good at cooking. Hell, planning ANYTHING nowadays feels like climbing a mountain.Does anyone have similar problems, like lack of appetite? How do you refrain from giving into cravings/comfort eating? How do you manage your daily food intake when depression takes away most energy and enthusiasm to do anything at all? How do you deal with apathy, the kind that makes it hard to even walk from the couch to the bed? How do you keep afloat? Because I am on the verge of drowning. No appetite during day, cravings at night\n",
      "Statement 48: I am so damn exhausted of my mind screwing everything up. I am about to turn 30 in a few weeks and although I have been fortunate enough to have had many women interested in me throughout the years, I just cannot seem to hold a stable relationship for longer than a few months. When I was younger it was not a huge deal, but now that I am getting older I am beginning to feel I may never be able to develop a long-lasting meaningful romantic connection with anyone and it makes me feel so deeply alone.The thing is, I am able to clearly see how it is me pushing my partners away. Once the initial excitement wears off, I go back to being aloof, insecure and self-centered and I can sense my masculine essence eroding. I can see how my partners go from being attracted to me to feeling sorry and completely turned off. I do not blame them. I do not want them to carry any of my burdens. I want to own up to them and keep fighting to get better. But with each passing relationship, I just become more afraid of opening up about my mental struggles and having them realize that the confident, fun version of me is kind of a part-time deal.On top of it all, I seem to be developing some kind of body dysmorphia. Depression sure seems to have done a number on me physically and its causing me to age a lot more quickly than my peers. I am rapidly losing my hair, about a third of my beard and body hair is already gray, I have bad eye bags and dark circles and, although I have tried, I just do not look good completely bald and I have been told as much by friends. I legitimately hate looking in the mirror most days. I even started dating older women in hopes that it would even things out, but the same thing happened.My last partner recently left me after I became insecure and started acting weird and it really hurt me because I actually did care about her. But somehow, just a week later, the universe has already put two new women in my life who are showing interest. The thing is, I am seriously afraid of trying this again and screwing it up once more. I do not think my heart can take much more disappointment and I am tired of superficial connections.I know I need to develop self-love and find something to get excited about every time I wake up before I try to find someone again, but the thing is I am also very lost and lack direction in life. The only thing I am truly passionate about is music, and that is just not going to pay the bills or provide me with the financial stability that a relationship requires. Besides that, I am working on finishing a degree in biochemistry (two semesters left), but I have no desire to go to grad school or Med school, and the job prospects with a B.S. in that field look bleak.Are there any guys out there who have managed to be in successful or satisfying relationships in spite of all your struggles? If so, how did you manage? I do not think my depression will ever go away at this point, and I do not want to end up alone or hurting myself and others even further. Thank you for reading.

      "Statement 1: I am so exhausted of this. Just when I think I can finally rest, just when I think maybe things are starting to settle, another hurdle comes flying at me. This month alone we found out my mum could be dying, my girlfriend left me, my parents revealed that they wanted a divorce, my grandad was hospitalised again and just now my little sister's been rushed to A&amp;E with possible brain damage. If there is a god up there they must fucking hate me. it is like life is trying to get me to kill myself and honestly I think I would be better off dead. I attempted when I was 12 but I was stupid and there was no way I could cut deep enough. Now I am 15 and everything is so much worse than it ever has been and I just cannot hold on much longer -- it is going to take a miracle to get me through this. I feel so alone. I feel like the world hates me and I have no idea what I did wrong to deserve this. I thought I was getting better. I was doing so well and now everything's just come crashing down again. I was thinking about carbon monoxide poisoning but I highly doubt there is any way for me to get that. it is looking like I will overdose but that is unreliable as fuck and surviving sounds like hell so i do not know. Just got to stick around long enough to make sure my sister's alright. I have already contacted one of my ex's friends to make sure they are looked after when I am gone. I do not think there is long left for me. Sorry. I have posted on this subreddit too many times in the span of a week and that is probably really annoying I just have absolutely no idea what to do anymore. I feel sick. If my sister dies then I really cannot do this anymore. It all hurts. Life is really fucking trying me\n",

I am just fucking ugly and all I want is to find a person to love..I feel disgusted by myself that I am jealous of my friends and I just want to end it all but I just see my family's faces and I do not want to put them through this..

My fiancee went out of town on Tuesday as well which just made things worse. I feel useless and tired and just like shit in general. I think it is hitting extra hard because I have been doing so well for so long. I would talk to my fiancee but she is been through so much with me that I cannot bear to put this on her.

Because of that, I always quit the website and do sonething else stupid instead of searching for some comforting text.

      "Statement 7: Everyone in my schooling system thinks I am autistic but I really faked it so my school work would be easier, I stopped going to school because I do not fit in there with anyone and nobody likes how different I am, I have problems about my body I have a dent on my chest and it makes me so self conscious I cannot do anything that requires me to not wear a shirt or people laugh at me and call me an alien, I have a gf but as of recently she is been loosing connection to me since she has her bestfriend back she does not want to be my bestfriend anymore, I have some friends they are really nice but I do not think they understand me, I think that my Dad hates me because I am not the son that he wanted, I feel like a disappointment to him and my family name because I am \"autistic\" and I have not gone to school for 3 years and I feel weak because I was molested and used when I was 10. I am 17 years old. I do not have a job and I used to be a drug dealer 1 year ago just because I hated going to school, when I was dealing I was addicted to MDMA and Xanax, they have both helped heavily with destroying my views and how I see myself, I have lost all of my happy emotions the only feelings that I feel is sadness and hatred to who I am. I cry almost every day of every hour just because living in my body hurts my soul so much. I do not belong on this planet or in this body. I hope nobody feels the ways that I do it is a shit feeling, I just needed to get this off my chest. I am planning on trying DMT as I have experienced LSD over 30 times but I would just like to try it to see if it changes anything about myself and if it does not change me I do not want to live here anymore. Sorry for huge wall of text Ik a lot of people on this subreddit probably do not actually care about anyone venting you all just care about punctuation and karma but I am doing it anyway I do not feel comfortable on this Earth anymore and I want to die\n",
      "Statement 8: I have so many stressors in my life, all major things that tear me down. Every day I fight a battle not just with my mental health but with the world. Last night I finally broke. After 33 years of a shit show of a life, I am done. What ultimately triggered this is that my son (7m) with ADHD has been expelled from holiday club. I quit my job Jan 2020 because he was not coping in school and managed to find him a specialist educational provider as well as get him on medication. He did brilliantly! I however, hated being a SAHM and a carer. The loneliness is overwhelming and the fact that I only live to provide food and a clean house to 3 children. So, I started to think about going back to work in my area of specialty which is law. I got a job with a police department. Something for me and something where I will meet other adults without being attached to my children. I got all 3 of my children into a childcare provider and settled them in over months. I have officially been working for less than 2 weeks and my son has regressed back to his bad behaviour. He has been kicked out and now I have to quit my job and go back to being his full time carer. I cannot do this for the next 11 years of his life and possibly beyond that. I do not want to live anymore and there is no help out there for my situation. I can go back on antidepressants, I can go to therapy but none of these things fix my problem that I no longer have any autonomy over my life. I am not a person any more, I am merely a mum with no identity other than that of my children. I find no pleasure in anything and exhaust myself pretending to be happy for the sake of my family. I cannot work, and now as it turns out I cannot even die. I cannot leave behind my children, I am their only parent. I have no control in this life over anything. I now think I am too far gone to ever feel happy again. I want to die. I cannot go back to Groundhog Day\n",

I started brainstorming and drafting what is useless and what is not, decided whether to post or write by hand, and checked for grammar. But I felt like even my last piece of writing, however short, was not good enough. Nothing I do is ever good enough. that is how it has always been.

What can I do? Nothing is fun anymore and I have no one. It gets worse everyday.

But it literally has destroyed me. I have got no fight left in me. Life just is not meant to be for me. I have had enough\n",
      "Statement 18: Yes. It is necessary. However it is not a cure and does not fix everything. It does not fix trauma or trust issues when they are deeply ingrained because nearly everyone in your life abused and betrayed you. It does not fix depression. Coping mechanisms only go so far. You go to therapy, you talk about it, they give you coping mechanisms that trauma, depression and anxiety supersedes. And you have to trick yourself into having a positive mindset to the point where it is toxic or invalidating or bypassing very real issues sometimes. I hate it. If you do not have love, support or an environment that is not triggering then sometimes therapy is not enough. A recent K-pop star attempted suicide and all I see in the comments are: Get therapy. She needs professional help. The presence of a therapist is only temporary. Even if they are a good one. What about being home alone with your thoughts, trust issues and depression? What about feeling like you need to be held all the time? there is no medium for that. For Christ's sakes. I am so sick of people telling people to get therapy.\n",

      "Statement 24: // general narcissist venting, feel free to comment if you wantThe thought of dying without being able to see if anyone cares or not just fucks with me too much to actually commit suicide. I mean of course they would care. People even care when strangers die. The initial shock of someone you knew dying and knowing that you could not do anything about it is very traumatizing. But I think what would affect them is the idea of a family member dying, and not that they would miss things about me or reminisce over memories or anything like that. The only memories they have of me is me being a dumbass or saying \"what?\" five times in a row because my hearing is going.But the thought of this makes me want to go out and be something that I know I cannot be. I want to make something of myself but I just, I cannot. I have nothing to put on my resume, I cannot do taxes, there is so many obvious things that other people know that I just do not! And nobody thinks to tell me because I should already know! Why do not I already know basic crap! Why did I spend my childhood locked in my room instead of trying to learn and develope like a normal child! Why cannot I take care of myself without burning out? If I brush my teeth, shower, get dressed, and do my hair routine all in the same day then I am burnt out! that is it! I cannot do anything else for the day, I am too tired! there is no way I could work or get a job like this! I would burn out after one task and get fired! I hate that my huge sense of self importance has manifested into me always focusing on how I am the worst instead of atleast making me delusional enough to think that I am the best. I hate that my self esteem is based on other people's approval, but unlike other narcs I do not get approval because I am literally shit at everything so I am just an unmotivated sack of shit who cannot do anything. I hate that I even told anyone that I am a narc. Of course they would not accept me!! What the hell was I thinking!! What kind of idiot would expect anything different!! Things are not going to get better for the NPD community, not in my life time atleast! Well, maybe that will be another reason to stay alive. Imagine being an old man and seeing 20 something year olds openly talk about their NPD recovery process that they felt no shame entering because there is no more stigma, experiencing something I could not. Maybe. When I am in my 80s. And my mom, my poor mom. She has to pay for everything because I cannot do shit on my own. Physical therapy, regular therapy, medication, my food, I hate this!! You should not have to take care of me!! You should be relaxing somewhere without worrying about my next diagnosis or my next medication or whether or not any treatment is working!! You should be doing your hobbies and I should be the one buying you things!! Maybe I will get to the point of recovery where I am not so self-centered, and then I can finally let go. And they can all finally live their lives. I wish I was not such a narc so I could just find peace in death\n",

      "Statement 30: Content warning: Please do not read this post if you are suicidal/prone to suicidal thoughts. I do not want to trigger a negative spiral for anyone else.I am 19M from Turkey. My family history from the maternal side is filled with mental health issues, I have a depressed mother and a suicidal sister who is older than me. I have a very sensitive temperament, am very neurotic and introverted. I am somewhat bright academically (not a genius, but significantly above average), have no hobbies or social life. Ever since the age of 13, I have been severely depressed and isolatedI know maany people have it much harder than me, and I am somewhat in a privileged demographic but I really need to vent without holding back. Living in Turkey is very hard nowadays with the islamo and nationalistic fascist regime, and even if I want to migrate, I will be met with some degree of prejudice because I am a middle easterner. I do not want to leave my country ideally too, but there is no choice other than to strive for an escape. I am not religious, believe life is meaningless. Those are not the reasons behind my depression, though. I do not give a shit about life being meaningless, because I know the brain only seeks happiness and meaning is irrelevant in this case. The problem is, I cannot fulfill my needs and it is destroying meMy lack of social life especially hurts in my relationships with girls. I have gone through many rejections, only to deduce thata) my need for approval is making me unattractiveb) I am not good/attractive/sociable enough for women to take notice of me, want meOf course nobody tells those to my face, they are rather the constant messages I come across reading dating advice blogs, psychological studies on attraction etc. It is even more depressing when dating, intimacy and relationships are portrayed through a lens of competition. And even more depressing that I have no satisfying counter arguments against that. I, too, can see that this is all just a competition; but some of us (me included) are not comfortable admitting. I remember listening to the talks of evolutionary psychologists, how they talk about \"everyone is trying to get the best deal they can\" and \"you may be miserable as an 8, since you lust after 10s but 6s lust after you.\" Dating is a market; and I just cannot see how you can be happy or fulfilled unless you are in the 1% as a maleI know suicide, if done right, would be the same as falling asleep, just not to wake up. I know painless ways, and losing hope in ever attaining a fulfilling intimacy just makes me lose interest in living. I have a very painful daily lived experience, and I just wish for the pain to go away but it persists. There is always an unfulfilled need for love, and it is veery hard to fulfill that need. And I do not have the skillset to have it fulfilled (and mind you; I have been trying very hard to be social. My temperament is just too apparent)I am going to wait for my therapy sessions. I just want this painful feeling of isolation and rejection to go away. And it will not. I may decide on killing myself a year later if I feel the same way, and things did not change I am considering suicide\n",

I am still living with my parents, and my mom keeps all pills (&amp; other things i could use to hurt myself) in her room. she fills up a pill container for a few days, no more than 4 at a time. and will not let me take more atarax which i need throughout the day, so i have to ask her continuously. she also does not think i should take much, even though the safe amount is way more than i take everyday.basically, i do not get why I am trying if nothing is changing. i attempted my worst attempt about a year ago, I am about 5 months clean from self harm and am not suicidal! when does the trust come back? i understand she is scared, that is valid. but i will not grow at all if I am kept under lock &amp; key forever. why am i trying\n",
      "Statement 33: A week ago I was fine. Now all my friends hate my guts, and I cannot go outside because I have fuckhbg Covid. If the virus does not kill me then I sure as hell will do its job for it My life has gone downhill so fast\n",
      "Statement 34: Why am I so stupid? I fell for someone who cannot love me back. Loving him hurts so much but I do not know how to stop. I know he will not be in my life forever and when he starts college I will not have much chance to see him anymore. I really do not want us to just slowly drift apart and stop talking. I do not want to be alone. I already have nothing to live for and if hes gone as well there will not be anything worth staying alive for. I hate myself for loving someone\n",
      "Statement 35: Throwaway account because God forbid anyone who actually knows me sees this.I am just tired and it does not even feel worth it anymore. It just feels so futile and hopeless to stay alive.I was diagnosed with adhd, depression, and binge eating disorder in February, I am on medication and yet I am still fucking up a lot. I am still late for work on occasion, I am still having a hard time getting things done around the apartment, I keep telling myself that I will do good things like cook healthy food and wake up and take walks and wash my face \"from this point forward\" but it never happens or I do it for a day or 2 and cannot keep it up.Before, I thought what my family said was true and I am just lazy but I cannot function without medication. And what is the point of living a life where I need medication and I am still having trouble getting it together anyway? I would rather be dead than wasting air and people's time. I Wish I Was Dead\n",
      "Statement 36: I have been going through a lot lately and all I can think of is taking my own life. All I feel is pain and depression and I am honestly not sure if I really want help or just for everything to end I need help\n",
      "Statement 37: I do not know what my purpose is on this planet. No idea what I want to do in terms of a job. I feel no passions or have any kind of dream i wish to chase. It makes my life and existents almost feel pointlessWhat am I actually here for. what is the point in living 80 or more years unhappy. I just want to not exist but that is not possible without serious repercussions Just wanted to rant and see if I was the only one. Struggling to understand a purpose\n",
      "Statement 38: I have posted about it several times, but here goes. 12 months ago I joined a dating website and met a Thai woman. We got on EXTREMELY well. I thought she was the one for me. It later transpired that she had 2 children which she did not tell me about. Odd, but ok. I decided to go with the flow and see whether we could make it work. Shortly after, we got into a relationship.One night I video-called her and she did not reply. She said she was feeling unwell and she would see me tomorrow. When I turned up the next day, she was standoff-ish. I saw her phone on the side so I grabbed it and took a look at her photo album, looking for the photos we would taken a week earlier.I was horrified to see a picture of her in bed with another man. she would cheated on me the night I called her. Even worse, after I confronted her, she told me it was for money. Yes, he would paid my girlfriend to sleep with him. Turns out she was on some kind of dating app and had arranged that behind my back. There were a few other guys she would arranged to see but she did not in the end.She assured me it would not happen again and she had not done it before. Turns out it was all a big fat lie. I found out she was a hooker. By this point we would already given it another go. I would got attached to her and her two. children. I would cooked for them, bought them things - I felt like a part of their family.Anyway, I thought it was all going well and that was behind us, when she cheated. Again. I saw a guy online reviewing her. Yes, REVIEWING her service(s) and he described what happened and how much she charged. I was devastated. I cried buckets of tears.Fast forward a few months and we had given it another go and we were getting along well - when all of a sudden she dumped me. She said she was going back to that lifestyle and it left me a broken man. I would loved her, forgiven her several times, I would been looking after her children. I did absolutely everything I could for them. I am just left with pain. I will not commit suicide, but the pain has been so bad I have thought things like: \"when I am gone I will not be in this pain\".she is blocked me on everything. I called her phone from another number and she hung up when she heard my voice. she is treated me like a piece of trash. At an all time low\n",
      "Statement 39: I have been in therapy and I feel so much better. it is been a year since the last time I thought about ending my life, I have done so much work and I still have to, but I feel really proud of myself. It gets better, I promise!! I no longer want to kill myself\n",
      "Statement 40: i do not know why i even had hope that it would get better. Things only get worse and i hate when people say it will get better. My mind is telling me to give up everyday I am trying to fight but i do not think i was made for this world. I love my parents and they are very caring but i do not think that is enough reason for me to keep going. I have nothing going for me and i hate myself. I remember when i was a kid and was actually happy with myself but those days are long gone. Now all i can think about is how worthless i am and how i do not belong. I think this might be my last few days here. I hope everyone has a good day and keeps fighting. it does not get better\n",
      "Statement 41: does anyone have experience with brain damage after a suicide attempt? brain damage\n",
      "Statement 42: I am not sure if I am incredibly mentally unwell but scrolling through gore posts and seeing failed suicides make me incredibly scared that if I fail, I would be horrifically deformed and the pain would get worse. Gore subs and website scare me into not committing suicide.\n",
      "Statement 43: I cannot do it. I cannot do it. I cannot do it. I want to die and its all they care about\n",
      "Statement 44: I tried it a few times but it never worked except for the last time but I got scared and called the ambulance. But now I am sad again and I think about killing myself again.My medication does not help me enough and everyone seems to hate me that is why I cannot find a reason to stay alive. I do not want to live anymore\n",
      "Statement 45: All it takes is any small thing to trigger me into suicidal me. Can I please talk to someone, I need a friend. I hate how I go from 100 feeling amazing, to wanting to blow my brains out in seconds\n",
      "Statement 46: Have to tie up a few things. Final blow came today. I am done. I survived an attempt over a year ago and since then things have got considerably worse. I cannot manage myself in this world. I cannot do the things other people do. I do not understand the tricks people do to get along. it is not mental illness. it is this place. I hate it. I always did.I love you all. Over and out. Checking out\n",
      "Statement 47: Cannot take this domestic bs anymore and do not think it will ever end. did not ask for this crap, and did not ask to be born either. I hope my piece of crap father burns in hell for putting me in this situation which has not been helped by some of my decisions either. cannot wait to end it. Will end it soon now\n",
      "Statement 48: Today I was on guard duty in my base. I went back to my room and recieved a call from my commander, saying that I was spotted going to my room with my cartirage inside my m16. I told him its not true and that I removed the magazine myself. Apparently, you are not allowed to do that and now I am going to be trialled. I am so scared. I do not want to be trialed. I want to go home, I want to finish it right now. I do not know if I should pull the trigger.... I have a gun in my room, I think about it a lot, but I do not know if I should.\n",
      "Statement 49: I am sad and I am scaredGuys i do not know where else to turn to with my feelings right now. I am just so frustrated. I have been in my antidepressants for 6 weeks now and I am not doing okay this past week. I Do Not Know if its the circumstances of my life right now or if my medication is not working.. what started this all was me kicking my sister out of my house for disrespect and overstepping boundaries, then basically my mom was supposed to go to rehab so I dedicated 2 days to try and help her get ready.. while I was at her house getting her ready some drama happened and My sister (the one I kicked out) was trying to fight my mom, so I just stepped between them and then my dad comes between me and my sister and yells at me like I was the one instigating. He backed me into a corner almost yelling and cussing at me. He never touched me, but he kept walking towards me so of course I stepped back. And it just brought back bad memories of my childhood but not a specific one if that makes sense anyway I ended up bringing her to the airport the second day. Well something happened at the airport that was neither of our fault and she said she did not want to go anymore so that upset me and I cried the entire way to her house which was an hour. Then my cat has to have his leg amputated and its going to cost us $1000 or more after everything is said and done with his er visit, preop exam, and surgery My sleep schedule has been messed up and it gets worse everyday. I sleep till 4 in the afternoon and I am ashamed of myself. I feel disgusted by myself honestly. I start school august 18 and part of me feels like I cannot make it because of the way I am dealing with stress right now. I am over whelmed and now I am discouraged and that makes me feel ever worse. I hope someone can understand what I mean. Its almost like I am sad BECAUSE I am sad in a way. I am in therapy but I did not get to make it to my appointment yesterday because of my sleep schedule and also staying home with my cat. I have no friends and I feel like I annoy everyone so that puts me into antisocial mode. I just want it all to stop. I was doing so good the first 4 weeks of my meds and slowly it got worse and I feel I am right where I was before and I am scared that I am ganna have to be depressed forever because medication is not working . I am sorry if this sounds dramatic but its literally how I feel. I just feel hopeless, my antidepressants have not seemed to be working this past week AT ALL.. I just wish I had a friend who has been through this to kind of help me because I am lost.\n",
      "Statement 50: Hey um, I do not like talking to strangers but I feel like I need to do something before it goes too far down the rabbit hole. I am 30 with a 1 yr old and another coming in December been married to 2 yrs (do not know for how much longer though). I write songs to cope( I will post them if you want to read them) but to be honest I will not lie I want to throw my hands up so bad..... I am angry with a lot different things. I miss the me before I got corrupted with life and it is experiences. I cannot be an effective father and husband like this. Truthfully ik my family would be better off without me. No more worrying about me. They could focus on themselves. Idek why I am posting this. Maybe crying through reddit. Looking for God through. Hell....i do not know....

      "Statement 1: I do not know how to navigate these feelings, not that its a new feeling by any stretch. I just do not understand how I can go on from being so pleasantly fine to suicidal and self loathing within in minutes and not be able to step out of it. I have been suffering from poor mental health for over 10 years and I am about to turn 26 next week and I feel so ashamed for how serious my negative thoughts are. Covid was a hard transition especially having moved to a new city a few months before everything started locking down, but now I am here and settled and I have a loving partner, a great connection to their family, a really fun job and I finished my degree. But when I stop and look around I feel like nothing will ever be good enough for me and I will never be good enough, I will always have skin problems and bad teeth and acne. I will never be the artist I used to be (I have a Bachelor in fine art) because I do not have the same drive or passionate that I used to have for it. I will never have the career I built my entire plan around because I am losing my interest in art. I will never have the relationship with my family that I want because I could not stand to stay in my hometown. All I can feel is this tornado of my failures swirling around me all the damn time. It just seems that no matter how many positives come my way they do not last long enough to out weight the negatives. I do not really know what I am looking for I guess I just wanted to say this out loud, or whatever. 0 to 100\n",
      "Statement 2: I am going to make this short because i hate thinking about it, but long story short, I am getting better after months of medication, therapy, etc. My anxiety is at an all-time low and my antidepressants \"\"do not allow\"\" my mind to wander too much into suicidal thoughts. But i hate it, i hate that I am getting better, i feel embarrassed whenever i catch myself doing something not depressing, like taking a walk, laughing, or doing stuff by my own will. And i feel SO SO selfish, i was given immense support from everyone, my mum has spent so so much time and money on therapists, psychiatrists, pills, etc; she is suffered more than anyone else, even more than me since i seem to enjoy being depressed. she is the happiest she is been in months since she can tell I am in a better mood and she is the only reason i have not \"tried harder\" to get worse, but i do not know how long i can keep it going.Something in me just wants me to maybe stop taking my meds without letting her know, get a new self destructive habit, and go back to the old me that did not leave his bed in days and could not keep a conversation for more than 2 minutes, i really miss it.I am going back to school in a couple of months (i dropped out), i started driving lessons yesterday, I am eating better, sleeping better, I am starting to live and behave like a regular person but i cannot handle it, it makes me feel bad, gross, EMBARRASSED, very embarrassed, and its just a cycle of:I am ok this makes me depressed I am ok again this makes me depressed etc.I do not know what to do, I am not even sure why i am even writing this since I will probably end up ignoring whatever help or advice i get, but i guess i needed to vent, thanks for reading and as always sorry for my english how can i be happy about getting better??\n",
      "Statement 3: I have been talking to someone who I really liked. They were a great person and we really clicked. I told her that I could not do this with her because I am dealing with so much shit in my head that it is not fair to her. She said she wanted to be there for me and I shut her down. I am scared to be depressed around other people now. My poor mental health ruined one relationship and I do not want it to ruin another. I know I am much better now than I was in my previous relationship but I am scared that I might be a horrible person again.I am scared to let anyone be close. I feel like I am just getting by daily and cannot make any real connections anymore. The ability to get close to people is non-existent because I am scared that when they see the real me, they will leave. I am trying to improve but what if I cannot, what if I fall apart again? What if I am the piece of shit suicidal asshole that I was before? I am scared to put anyone through that. I kept making up excuses for why this was not going to work out. Distance, what we wanted, culture, but truthfully I am just fucking scared to be close to someone again. I am scared to be vulnerable. I wish I knew how to not be depressed. It controls my life. I hate it I am pushing people away\n",
      "Statement 4: I am 19 male. Both of my parents where immigrants my dad died in a car accident and my mom crazy and killed herself shortly after when I was 8. My only family left was my grandma. She raised me and I fucking love her so much, but she is old and has Alzheimers. Its so fucking hard seeing her drift away. I should be grateful that I was given such a loving and awesome grandma for the time she was there. I just do not know what Ill do when she forgets me. My depression has really gotten bad I do not want to take paxil because I am scared of the suicidal thoughts. Any tips? What do I even do?\n",
      "Statement 5: I no longer look forward to ANYTHING. I have a beautiful girlfriend, a caring family, job opportunities, talent, looks, personality, but inside I am miserable and have lost my love for life. I spent about 3 years of my life going through all the popular antidepressants, benzodiazepines, etc. but none of them worked. I no longer drink alcohol because I abuse it and I no longer smoke weed because when I do, I smoke non-stop and get even more depressed. I am at the end of my rope and I no longer know what to do. I am not going to commit suicide but I just wish I could find some hope. Any suggestions would be appreciated I am 27 (m) &amp; Everything in my life is picture perfect from the outside, but my depression is eating me up inside day by day.\n",
      "Statement 6: I grew up being a very bad kid, i smoked weed from age 9 first time i got drunk i was 13, since child hood we moved from place to place, never had my friends as we always moved, since i was 18 i moved away from my parents to another country and 3 years later, still cannot make friends because people are so fucking antisocial here, i lost my first son after 3 days of birth due to placenta seperation, and now my job is pissing me off, i want to break up with my gf but i love her, money is a big issue and recently I have been having suicidal thoughts and other thoughts, is there anyone that has any tips? Tired of living, weird thoughts\n",
      "Statement 7: I am okay with dying or living but I will not fight for either. Like if I get a terminal illness, Ill probably just let it be. I cannot imagine myself reaching 30, I expect that somewhere between my college and grad school years, Ill just die of some illness or probably suicide but I do not really want to commit suicide because of my family will blame each other and stuff like that and also my mom, I do not want to put her in a situation like that. I am okay with getting killed through natural causes where no one gets blamed. Right now, I think I am okay with this; nothing really matters anymore or something. Basically I do not have a will to live or a reason to fight for my life should I be in a fatal situation. I know some people feels like this too but i do not know what this is\n",
      "Statement 8: I am tired of putting up a fake smile, fake laugh and shit. I think I am depressed, like I have a lot of self-hatred, suicidal thoughts almost everyday. it is so fucking hard to concentrate on studies. My phone is my only escape. I do not know what the fuck to do now. I do not know if I am depressed or am I just acting like and idiot. I do not know what the fuck I am going to do now.\n",
      "Statement 9: I have had more downs in my life than ups to be honest but the main core of this situation was and still is because of my parents' we were taught to respect them and love them because they were the ones who raised us and \"put a shelter over ours heads\". For me these last two years were absolute hell and it was not because of the pandemic but there are several reasons like:1. I am pretty smart and got into med university by the age of 17 and because of the amount of stress and trauma I had to deal with I failed2. After failing my parents gave me a second chance to reenter the university and I took it but I was so unhappy that I chose not to do it and went against my parents simply because I was severely depressed and hospitalized due to psychological pains like constant chest pains and I could not breathe3. My parents were not supportive of me. They were supportive when they where showing off to their peers or friends and my dad told me \" You are nothing but a disappointment and you embarrass us wherever we go\" I was highly discouraged4. I still get yelled at and pretty much am verbally insulted and was told I cannot do shit in life because I am a complete failure. I really hated when my dad used to tell me \"You are going to be a doctor so you should know this\". The only thing I know, is that I really really hate you and this hate adds up even more daily.5. I have this new opportunity where I technically can go to another country and go to university there and my parents will not be able to come. I feel so restrained and so closed in like in a box and I suffocate so I feel like I should say fuck you to my parents and leave but I do not know how well I can deal with myself there too6. Technically they killed all my dreams, what I could have became and they took my dreams and crushed it and are the MOST negative people I have ever seen in my life and I do not even want to look at them. I know it is unethical to hate your parents but do not blame the ones they do because some parents clearly suck and I even told them \" You should have never became parents\" or \"I wish I was never born I did not ask to you to be my parents\"My parents makes me want to kill myself and have suicidal thoughts and I cannot take it anymore. They do not know how to communicate at all and they have zero empathy and funnily enough my parents hate each other and themselves as well; weird how they have to reflect that on me too. I was an innocent kid with big dreams. I was not born to be insulted like this, they are the fakest people I have ever met too. Acting like they care about me in front of others all the fake hugs and such and ask me why I do not ever let them to hug me; it is because I hate you and I do not want to see you. I do not know what to do anymore...should I leave to another country and do not see them again? It seems pretty huge but I cannot deal with this kind of toxicity anymore.. It feels like it keeps getting worse\n",
      "Statement 10: I feel awful right now, and almost every night. I cannot go to bed anymore without realizing how much no one loves me, or how much I hate college! Its only worse that I have been thinking a little more about the idea of suicide. I swear, I am considering it after graduation. One day, I am feeling great, the next day just okay. Right now, I feel like absolute shit\n",
      "Statement 11: I am so fucking suicidal, but cannot bring myself to do it, i pull the knife to my throat but cannot convince myself, everybody in my family loves me, but myself. Why do i hate myself, there is no reason, am i just being a spoiled,ugly, brat? I feel like every part of me is too tired for anything, but i try, if i could i would sleep my life away. I try to convince myself to tell my family and reach out, but younger me has little devil ears and clicked the button of Life Ruiner. Is their anyway to kill myself, but painless and quick? Kill me\n",
      "Statement 12: My life is very hard. I am in pain all the time. I have been working on healing for years and there is been some improvement but overall I am still in bad shape. I can usually only sleep during the day. I play chess but my pain really affects my game and its really disappointing. I play guitar but have really low quality gear because I have no money. I live with my parents. I cannot work at all and my disability claim was denied. I sent it in an appeal, hoping for the best. Its always hard being around my father. It seems like hes so disappointed in me and it creates a very tense atmosphere. Its easier to be around my mom but its still hard. My older brother blew up at me a few weeks ago telling me how lazy I am. He does not believe I have a disability. He was incredibly insulting. I blocked him but he apologized so I am talking to him again. Hopefully it will stay civil. My younger brother is nice but does not really understand my situation. I spend all my time either at home or at the park a few feet from my house. I tried to get gas the other day but was too anxious. I drove by the gas station and went back home. My mental health has never been decent. In 2013 my physical health began doing downhill. One issue after another. No help from any of the many doctors I tried. I smoked weed every day from 12 to 18 to try and cope with my issues. When I got sober a lot of the people I thought were my friends wanted little to nothing to do with me. College was terrible. I dropped out my senior year. Every year got harder and harder since my health was declining. Then I moved back in with my parents and it was doctor after doctor, protocol after protocol. None of it helped. It generally just made things worse and Id voice this to my parents and it caused more tension. I was kicked out of the house countless times and often slept at motel 6 with the money I had at the time. I have had such a bizarrely difficult life. I have been expressing suicidal ideation since 3rd grade. I keep hoping things will pick up for me and that Ill finally reach a place where I feel stable. I have hopes and dreams. Well see what happens. Thanks for reading. All the best to you Tanner A difficult life\n",
      "Statement 13: i do not know if its depression last year i used to love studying and did it for around 8 hours on top of school because i just enjoyed it . maybe its burnout but now i cannot even study for 10 minutes without feeling like its not worth it. this is the course i wanted to study my entire life. i wake up in the morning full of anxiety and have to calm myself down because the thought of university is too much. maybe its the fact that i was anticipating life to be good at this stage and for me to be happy that now that I am not, it is heartbreaking. i will never drop out of school but i have considered suicide because staying does not seem worth it. I have a bf and a loving family but seeing them no longer brings me joy either. but i want to know if i should visit a doctor and get on medication or should i just wait it out for a few more months. not worth it\n",
      "Statement 14: i have been depressed most of my life, i am now 27 , and everytime i seem to get somewhere with being happy my mind just forces itself to become depressed again, back to the comfort zone.. i was reading that depression swells the brain over the years or something.. is it possible to be depressed beyond return? i have no wants in life at all anymore i have long just been waiting to die / contemplating suicide but the trail of destruction i would leave behind for my partner, parents, siblings ect is something i cannot do, i do not want to disperse my depression among those who have tried their best to help me. depressed beyond the point of return\n",
      "Statement 15: With what medications can I almost commit suicide? I just want to almost die and go to the hospital, I am running out of options to get my ex's attention, she did not care that i cut myself, I just want to talk to her. What meds or pills can i take?\n",
      "Statement 16: Hi my name is Pierre I am a 22 year old guy from Houston and for about 7 years I have been really depressed. A lot of people close to me really do not know because I have always been the funny guy that makes people laugh. I have had a tuff coming up me and my mother had a very bad relationship coming up I am not really close to my family but I love them though. I try to keep a smile on everyone is face if I can but at the end of the day I am somewhere questioning why am I alive I have thought about suicide multiple times but I have a niece and nephew that I could not do that too my relationship with my gf is so wierd I really like her but i know deep down she does not care about me its shows but I stay with her I am currently trying to get a car so I can move around without having to ask someone who dislikes me I am actually crying right now my heart is so heavy I can never keep anyone happy I understand men are not supposed to cry but man I just want to be happy and make others happy but it seems I cannot I pray but not as much as I should know I will not get a reply I am not to much worried but I needed to let something is off my chest it hurts sleeping in the bed with someone who is obviously cheating on you and is not interested but before I stayed with her I was homeless and just graduated she knows I do not have anywhere else to live so she treats me like shit because she know I do not have anywhere to go I am so tired of being tired no matter what I do lately the tears have been uncontrollable I need help I am tired I just want to be happy man with peace of mind please God I am so ready to end it all I cannot continue like this Help me\n",
      "Statement 17: I have had suicidal thought i do not know if that is a sign of sadness or depression ? Can someone help Am I depressed or just sad?\n",
      "Statement 18: Posting here mostly as a last resort since I feel like I bother others when I talk about my depression. I am a 23 years old girl and feel like a loser. I have suffered from depression for as long as I can remember, which was made worse when I was a teenager due to drug use/excessive drinking, being sexually assaulted, and briefly working as a sex worker although in a pretty sketchy way. I feel like no one cares. I feel like my friends do not really give a shit about me or would not care if I was not around. I feel like my band sucks even though I put so much of myself into it. I feel like people think I am stupid. I fear I may actually just be stupid. I feel unremarkable, worthless. I have not attempted suicide in many years but sometimes I feel I am getting there again. I feel unhappy in my relationships and I think the problem is and always will be me. I try DBT and am on antidepressants. Any advice is appreciated. 23 yo really depressed and feel lost.\n",
      "Statement 19: All I have to do is browse the reddit comments. \"You look like mom's neck beard basement dweller\", \"I would date your second chin\". And I think that some of these \"roasts\" could apply to me. I am a woman. I have been told I am attractive. I think I am. I only weigh 110 lbs and I am 5'6\". But I still have excess weight I gained after losing a pregnancy and being put on birth control. So the double chin comment really gets to me. Everytime I see a negative comment, I think about how my closest friends could say or think the same thing about me. Especially since one of my closer guy friends is a guy I crushed on, recently told and got rejected by in the nicest way possible. I have trust issues. I sometimes think I am not as great as I think I am in the moment. That my friends are internally roasting me in their heads while I look like an egotistical, arrogant, a-hole. Thank you for coming to my ted talk. Today's been rough. I have been struggling with suicidal ideation ever since I flirted with my guy friend again and made things akward. It seemed like he was flirting at first but I think I misperceived the intent in his speech and screwed up again. there is more to this story but I do not want to get into it. I cannot tell if I am overthinking, paranoid and waiting for betrayal or if my intuition is on to some things. So I deacti everything. I am staying away. I personalize insults aimed at other people then want to die.\n",
      "Statement 20: At first I thought it was normal to not feel anything to hate myself ect then when I was about 6-9 I became suicidal which was when I got the idea of it so I did not tell anyone Am I the only one here? I have been depressed for all my life\n",
      "Statement 21: Before I really wanted to be happy, i know it is not just something you can get but i was tired of being depressed all the time. At this point, I do not even want to be happy anymore. It seems like too much of a mess and too much effort for something that will not even last. I feel like i have already tried so many times to be happy, and none of them worked. Even when I have people that love me, friends, hobbies, life still seemed so shit. Is this just it? At some point i just stopped attempting and accepted that I will never be happy with my life. The only way i see an end to this is suicide, but I am just too scared to do that either. I also know that i will hurt some people if i do die, and in the end, i just feel like I am trapped here with nowhere to go. It makes it all the more frustrating that i hate being here but i cannot just kill myself . I feel like i do not even want to be happy anymore. I just want to die instead of doing anything else.\n",
      "Statement 22: that is it. I feel helpless, desperate and hopeless. My hair is damaged &amp; weak because I am stressing out, I am stressing about not being stressed enough, I want to be busy. I do not want to feel like this ever again. I cannot live anymore. My hard work will never pay off, so I am giving up.Fuck this shit, why only me? From now onwards, I will never do anything. I will never work hard, I will never practice, I will not give a fuck about my career and future. The toll that all of this has taken on me is that now I feel happiness only when I think about suicide. No pain, no sufferings, No worries, nothing. I give up.\n",
      "Statement 23: I am 25 years old and I have never had a girlfriend, had sex, ben on a date, kissed, held hands, been touched by, been asked out, etc. I graduated college last May. At my on campus job I became friends with a girl who I eventually fell head over heels in love with.I have been in love with her since 2018. Was rejected and ghosted in 2020. She texted me last year to say hi, I answered and she never answered me back. I cry constantly and have been grieving every day for 3 years.The pain from never being able to be with her has made me suicidal and I have already attempted but failed to hang myself a few times. Its something I have to cope with every day. Its a sickness that never goes away. Its a pain that is not just emotional but physical. Again, I have been dealing with this every single day since fall of 2018.Something this is rooted in is my crush wrote poetry a lot and I bought a copy of a collection she published while we were still friends in 2019. In the collection tehre was a poem about her losing her virginity. Reading that absolutely destroyed me. It kept me awake for days. I could not stand the thought of someone else having sex with someone I loved so dearly and longed to care for so much. One day, she confided in me that her recent ex had been physically abusing her. More pain. Id fantasize about having sex with her but it would not help. I just imagined what it would be like if she actually loved me back and was attracted to me.Its getting to the point where everything related to having sex and relationships in general is painful to me. I even am starting to experience sexual dysfunction: I do not get aroused as easily amd I can no longer watch pornography because it upsets me to see people being intimate because it makes me jealous and depressed that the is something I have never experienced before. I hear people talk about their gfs and wives and I get extremely sad.I found out my 20 year old sister lost her virginity months ago and when I did I cried for days. I felt indescribably disgusting and pathetic. I am 25. I should have lost my virginity first. I should have a gf or wife by now. Everything related to sex and relationships makes me violently depressed. It ruins my day.I am so fucking sick of feeling like this. Every time I hear about sex i just think Yep, another person experiencing what Ill never get to experience. Everything and anything related to sex makes me want to kill myself.\n",
      "Statement 24: I am 17, been on Effexor for about a year. I was suicidal before starting it and now I feel mostly fine. I am going off of it because I feel like it has affected my ability to maintain relationships - both girlfriends I have had while I have been on it, I feel like I have not been able to actually connect with them emotionally, like I cannot fall in love with them. I have heard other people share similar stories. Also, I am sexually active with my girlfriend and I cannot cum - we have had sex probably like twice a week, for the last 2 months, and I have finished exactly 1 time. Its horrible. For a while I could not even get it up. But anyways, that is why I am going off it. What should I do to try to prevent my depression from coming back once I am off it? I am currently in the process of weaning off of Effexor. I am at like half of my dose of 75 mg, planning on cutting that to 0 in 2 weeks or so, once I run out of pills. How do I make sure my depression does not come back after going off of antidepressants?\n",
      "Statement 25: I have been hiding my tears all day and my boss let me leave early. I thought spending close to $1k would help me cope, but it did not. Now I am just home and feeling worse. I want to attempt suicide once more, last time I really almost did it, until my brother found me. It just brought shame and made me want to move so my family will not find my body. My only real friends are all online and I feel really lonely. At this point I am thinking of making a plan, find my cat a home, give away my belonging and then end it. I am done trying, nothing ever works out for me. I want to be free already\n",
      "Statement 26: let us see.... where to begin. I feel like I am stuck in a rut. I have 2 people I can truly call a friend, I bury myself in work (80+ hours a week), and on my spare time I sit at home alone. I hate myself 90% of the time, my depression/anxiety is a bitch, I feel like I would be better of dead, or at least alone. I crave attention, but hate when it is given. My thoughts are dark, sometimes scaring myself, its like I am in a race with myself, and I am losing. I am single, not attractive, early 30s male. I have a job, car, apt., motorcycle, etc. but something is missing. I do not actively seek out a relationship anymore, to me it seems pointless. Any ideas on how to cope? Oh, I an in no way suicidal. I just feel like I would be better off alone, falling off the radar, or dead. How to cope?\n",
      "Statement 27: I went to residential for 2 weeks and it was amazingly helpful. It did so much to change my outlook on things. While I was gone, my wife realized she can not keep doing this. I spent all of my momentum coming out of residential on convincing her to at least give us a chance. I was able to get a job, only one place even reached out after I applied. It is physically wrecking my body. I am in pain every day. The pay is crap. Plus I am sleeping in the guest room which has a shitty mattress. I do not know if I can make it through this. I got home from work tonight actually feeing pretty good. My wife was out so I just lounged around for a bit. I felt like I was getting some of my confidence back. Then it came crashing down around me. I am still a fat ass, unattractive. My wife told me before I even went to residential that we needed to stop with the physical in part because I need to lose weight. Before she got home I moved my shotgun out of our, sorry *her* room and put it in my closet. Just in case. I promised her months ago that suicide was off the table, that I was all in. What good did that do me? I applied to yet another job. If I do not get it, I think that will be the end of it all. It will be the first time I fire my shotgun. With my luck it will not work. I can not even work up enough to care. Falling Again\n",
      "Statement 28: As much supportive as my bf is with my depression, its so fucking scary to tell someone that would never do this that if it was possible to kill myself painlessly, I would. I think I got to the conclusion today that my life is not going to get better if I do not admit this. However it feels like such a selfish thing to do because I do not him fo worry all the time and this to mess with his mood. I feel like I am selfish with everyone for not caring because I am so depressed, and then I also feel like its selfish if I tell someone that I would like to die because of the burden I am putting on them. Please help me by saying how you told someone you felt this way and how they took it.Note: I am aware that I need a psychiatrist and probably taking meds How to explain to someone your suicidal thoughts\n",
      "Statement 29: I am just fed up of everything. Everything and everyone pisses me off and I have tried to be happy but that just does not work. I have made plans of suicide for sometime after i pass my driving test and get a car. Its the only thing i can think of, I have tried self harm but I am too scared of pain, thought about jumping off a building like my brother tried but I am a coward and anything else is too painful or I am scared to do it. I know I have not passed my gcses because i did not try so I probably will not be able to get into college, I am so negative to everyone around me I am scared I am losing friends. Everything about me is just a fucking waste, anyone else could have been born in my place and done better, children are dying in impoverished countries who could have had great potential but people like me were born who are selfish and useless. I do not know what to title this\n",
      "Statement 30: I have been reflecting on my life a lot lately, and I always find myself going back and thinking about the bullying I have dealt with through my life. Hopefully sharing my story here can get some outside perspectives and give me an idea on how to move on.So a little about myself, I am a introverted guy whose hobbies fall in Video Games, anime and music. I have been playing video games since I was 3 and they have been my major escape for most of my life. I grew up in a small rural town for most of my life (From when I was born to my senior year, am currently 25) and was actually a pretty optimistic kid in my youth, free-spirited and just looking to have fun and make people smile. My parents have been pretty decent, but they were never around to support me so I mostly just stayed in my room playing games. It was around the age of 4 the I first experienced any sort of bullying. A couple of my older cousins would pick on me for some of the games I played. (I was a PlayStation kid growing and they were Nintendo kids and around 8-9 at the time this was happening) Unfortunately nobody really stepped in to stop them but things never went beyond verbal insults.This went on till I was about 8-9 myself and they grew up enough to stop it and we get along on the rare occasions I see them. Elementary school was pretty uneventful as I mostly just kept to myself. Middle school was where things took a turn for the worse.In my 5th grade gym class we had to start changing into gym clothes and I never got the memo that boxers were even a thing and was still wearing briefs at this point. We were all getting changed and I realized what was up, got really nervous because I noticed everyone else was wearing clothes that I did not even know existed and went into the one stall in the locker room to change, needless to say the locker room was full of boys making fun of the fact that I was wearing briefs. It was at this point most of the male classmates in my class and the grade above me started just verbally making fun of me, and the female students would either just do nothing or tell me to not make eye contact with them.By the time I got to my 6th grade, I only had a few friends and most of them were not actually friends with me and ended doing some things to me. I was getting no support from family or teachers and was started to feel isolated, so I tried to fake being cool, which did not really do anything in the long run. It was also this year where I saw another student in my grade wearing sweat pants to school, and since I had some figured I could wear some. I remember walking into class and a few classmates giggled a bit amongst themselves. I went to use the bathroom at some point in the day and on my way back was stopped by a female bully, who proceeded to call me gay and saying wearing sweat pants is \"for girls\" and other verbal insults. This was the only time I ever cried in school for something like this.I feel like I had to grow up really quickly emotionally in school due to a mixture of all this bullying and teachers would also make me hang out with special needs students, even if I did not want to. In 7th grade I had a crush on another girl in my class (She was one of the only people in my class, let alone the school that actually treated me like an equal person) and some of my \"friends\" physically dragged me over to her after I let them know that I had a crush on her and made me grope her breast, all the while I was begging them not to. (Thankfully she did not hate me for this)8th grade was the first time I can remember wanting to die, not exactly wanting to commit suicide but wishing I could just cease to exist. I started to become really jaded, I could not trust anyone save for a few friends that I barely saw because I was too busy still trying to live this \"cool\" facade externally but just feeling so angry inside. Being exposed to all these people hating and belittling me made me start loathing myself too. Near the end of the year, the same group of \"friends\" from earlier pressured me into smoking some cigarettes that they managed to find. (I do not even remember where) I took one whiff, and in the back of my head I just said \"that is it, I am done with these guys, this is not what I want to be\"I left that school with one friend that I had just made that year, social anxiety and self-hatred from all the harassment. I remember that summer feeling really lonely, like I was just existing but I lost a lot of my drive and happiness.High school was better at least, there was still bullying, nothing compared to my old school but I think some people could sense my insecurities and would pressure me into saying or doing things, I tried to own this \"one man wolf pack\" loner sort of shtick but deep down I just wanted to be accepted. Things ended completely by Junior year but by that point the damage was done.Nowadays I have a small group of friends who seem to like me for who I am. I still deal with the insecurities and fears from all those years ago and feel really emotionally stunted, like there is still this scared kid trapped in the body of this cold, logical body.For those who took the time, thank you so much for reading all of this, any advice on what I can do to move past my fears and insecurities are appreciated. Hopefully I did not come off as too whiny. Looking to share my story of being bullied.\n",
      "Statement 31: My depression is fucking everything. I have had to quit 2 different jobs (mechanic and lawncare). Both should not seem stressful but each caused my suicidal thoughts to sky rocket. I just need something low stress that likely will not because this what is a low stress jobs?\n",
      "Statement 32: Life is fcking crazy, I want everyone to realize how sad and weird life can get. I have been struggling deeply for the longest. To be honest I do not know why I am still going but I am hoping one day I can look back and be glad that I am still breathing. Everyday feels the same. I am constantly thinking about suicide but Ill probably never do it. Its a really sad feeling when you have no one to turn to. I am so scared of the future and where Ill be. Am I destined to be alone forever?? I have always thought it was cringe how people just rant on Reddit but here I am on Reddit. I hope I can look back on this post and remember these times. If anyone ever reads this.. know that we are looking at the same stars and moon and that you are not struggling alone. Everyday feels the same.\n",
      "Statement 33: Sorry if this sort of thing is not allowed, I just need to tell someone.I tried to kill myself when I was six, and once again a year later. I have never stopped being suicidal, I had to go to the hospital when I was 14 because I felt like I would kill myself. Since I was 12-13, I have been planning on killing myself when I am 19, the only reason why I did not kill myself when I was 14 was because I wanted to give myself a few more years for my life to get better. I have 2 years until I am 19, my life has only gotten worse. I have been saving up to get a (mentally) life saving surgery when I am 18. My family struggles with money and my dad does not pay child support, I want to kill myself so the money for the surgery can go to my family. Paying for one funeral will be a lot cheaper than spending money on me for the rest of my life when I will never even be happy. depressed\n",
      "Statement 34: I am tired of feeling tired of being depressed.My life is a bucket full of shit in which I stick my head into every morning.Most people are shallow and act only for their self interest but cover that under a veneer of false benevolence and think we cannot see through their bs. We live in a sick world where we only think about ourselves, use nice people ditch them then repeat the process. The idea of suicide seems more and more attractive to me as days go by Life is made of pain\n",
      "Statement 35: I was just on my bed, feeling suicidal as usual, and then I decided to try browse r/nihilism. I know it sounds odd but hear me out. The realisation that nothing is going to matter kind of helped me a bit. The ability to separate myself from my feelings and thoughts. Nothing will matter in the end, but that does not mean that you will never be able to feel validity in happiness. it is ok to just wander through life enjoying it until we die. I just got out of a suicidal spiral in 5 minutes and I am oddly proud of myself\n",
      "Statement 36: Is anyone having a particularly bad time right now? I really need to get outside my head, and maybe gain some perspective through the problems of others. Last summer I lost my job. I have been working towards improving my symptoms, and I do see a steady improvement. A few months ago I could not sleep for more than 3 hours. Falling asleep was almost impossible. My anxiety shot through the roof, as I was having daily panic attacks (a new thing for me). I lost my job, went back to school and got my degree. I am worried all the time. I ruminate all the time. I was bedridden for a few months and I lost about 50 pounds. My muscles have atrophied. My teeth rotted as I was not caring for myself. I am in a lot of pain physically and mentally. I cry multiple times a day sometimes uncontrollably. I will be 30 in less than a year and I feel like I am already dying. All I can think of is the negative, even though I have some positives. I am relatively healthy, no serious physical diseases.I have an amazing and beautiful girlfriend. I love her more than anything and she always returns the love tenfold. She has been trying to support me during this very dark period and I feel horrible for dragging her down. When the depression and anxiety were at their peak I was considering suicide every minute of the day. I had to call the suicide hotline and the lady I talked with used a tough love approach which actually helped put things in perspective. Anyway, even though the symptoms have been improving things keep happening in the middle of my recovery that trigger the anxiety and depression. Just yesterday when I was feeling quite good about my situation, I became the victim of identity theft. Here we go again. One step forward and 10 steps back. I obsess about things, and it has been driving me crazy. There are compounding problems contributing to this hole I have dug besides my mental health. I need a kind stranger to tell me what they are going through as well so I do not feel so alone. I am hurting really bad. My heart and spirit feel broken. Anyone else? Anyone Else Having The Worst Year of Their Lives? I desperately want to feel less alone and reading about the what others are going through helps.\n",
      "Statement 37: My partner broke up with me. We dated for 8 months and were extremely co dependant. It was not a healthy relationship because she did not want to get better and I wanted her to. We met up and she is with someone else as soon as a month after, an extreme alcoholic drinking 750mls every night and I am still in love with her.The breakup is what originally sent me into the depression, but it was not just that. Where I live was going above and beyond with covid restrictions even though people were getting vaccinated and you would be fined for even seeing your family. My parents were being insane, my brother was not doing well, and it took a huge toll on me too. More than I know, I think.Then I made the impulsive decision to get an apartment right after the breakup. The move in date is September 1st and as much as I should be happy, that makes me even more depressed for some reason.I have no friends with depression, I have no one that talks to me constantly (my ex did so I am feeling extremely lonely after just getting cut off from that), and I just feel so exhausted and alone. I want to go out, but I want to be alone. I feel nothing - literally nothing. I am just a numb husk that gets stuck in depressive thought loops over and over and wakes up to panic attacks.I have been in bed for over a week now, my room is beyond disgusting, I cannot eat and look like skin and bones, and my Dad basically has to take care of me because I cannot. I have gone out once or twice but I feel nothing the whole time. I cannot live like this. I have clinical depression and have extremely intense depressive episodes multiple times a year but this is the worst one I have had since I was in fucking jr high. (I am in college now). I think I am suicidal but I am so numb and empty I cannot even tell. The healthcare system in general, let alone the mental healthcare, where I live is abysmal but I am genuinely considering calling the crisis line and getting myself admitted to the mental health ward. The only thing stopping me is how much it would affect my family.I just feel so lost and SO alone and I do not know what to do. I think I came here to just talk to more people who are struggling like me, but if you have any advice please let me know. I am so tired. I am in one of the worst depressive episodes of my life.\n",
      "Statement 38: I have been walking around being productive, I have a boyfriend, I have emancipation papers (not filled out), I have this big plan on how I am going to go out and live life and pursue college. I have told all my friends that I am going to leave my family (which I feel like is emotionally and mentally abusive but I am not sure) and go get an apartment and finish highschool and go straight to college and then Med school. Problem is, I have not actually done any of that. This past year I got pulled out of school twice for suicide watch, my grades plummeted, I quit my sports team and I cut off most of my friends, I stopped showing up to work and I just tried to not to kill myself. Recently its been getting worse at home. My father has become more controlling, grounding me for stupid things, taking away my car, not letting me see my boyfriend or friends, gaslighting me for not spending time with him, etc. My mother has gotten better she has not manipulated me in a while so I think were fine. Her husband on the other hand, says that I am the reason my mothers health has deteriorated, both of my stepparents have said that I am the reason our family is dysfunctional. Sometimes I like to think I am stronger than others, that I have it worse than my friends, but that is not true at all. I am weaker than all of them. My life is so easy. So why should I want to stop existing? there is been awful shit that is happened when I was a kid Ill admit, but as of late lifes not as bad as it could be. I Do Not Know I just feel so stupid.

      "Statement 40: It has been 7 years since my brother died by suicide and honestly, life has never been the same but not better. He killed himself using a gun owned by my father and left a suicide note written in japanese ( he self-studied the language). We never saw the whole note since it was surrendered together with the gun to the police and my parents never wanted to read it. After his death, they burned all of his things (laptop, books, etc.) and never talked about the reason of his death ever again. There was always a time once a year when my curiosity got the better of me (I asked them if they could get a copy of it or if the police can translate it for us) and it always ended with disastrous fights with me against my parents. I always feel like I will never have my peace of mind if I will not be able to read about the letter.In the end, I always feel like the note could be some sort of closure for our family.Today, I feel like I just want to follow my brothers footsteps. My parents became more emotionally absent. They always feel like they are right and their ideas must always be followed. I also just feel like a burden to this family. I do not even see myself alive after 5 years. I just want to die. My brother died by suicide\n",
      "Statement 41: I have been trying to hold out on suicide for 4 years now, and last night, I remembered something horrible I did and broke down and lost it. The thought of it scars me and the people I hurt do not believe me when I genuinely say I am sorry either. Piled with the suicidal thoughts I have daily and family conflict was just too much.The only reason I am still here is because of my family and the friends who have not ghosted me out of concern for them. They cried begging me not to go and just hearing them like that is the only reason I have not tried again yet, they do not know how much it hurts hearing them say that.I really do not think it will get better and wished I was never born so everyone could be so much happier. I do not understand how people feel I deserve life when all I am is a waste of time and resources. I wish I never existed\n",

Just needed to get my thoughts out of my head so thank you if you read it and I am sorry for anyone who feels the same way as I do. Horrible intrusive thoughts/a need to vent\n",
      "Statement 43: 21M. So. I have been feeling depressed, very anxious and very low the past while. I grew up in a abusive household until I was 18, I moved in with my sister for 3 years and that turned toxic and it did not work out (she was angry, hatred, thinks she still hates me), I moved into student accommodation yesterday and I am still overwhelmed and depressed. I have been like this I was a little kid. but what is happened over the past few days just made me feel so low.My family were basically just my brother and sister. My sister now thinks I am backstabbing her for leaving. I tried to explain but she got over sensitive and angry, it is for the best. We were living in a 1 bedroom small flat. She was annoyed and unhappy over time. So I decided to leave, but she was not having any of it.So I got the bus an hour away from home to student accommodation. I got off the bus, ran to the bathroom and took a panic attack. I was there for 45 mins. Left walked round town and checked in to the accomodation. did not eat anything just spent most of the day annoyed and crying. So I was sitting for hours last night and this morning just anxiously looking to click that 'call' button on the support line. I explained my situation. They asked questions, asked about my GP and I agreed to have another assessment. They said it was a suicide line, but I have dark feelings, I feel hopeless alot, pretty much every day since I was no age. But I could not bring myself to end it, I just want the pain to end.It felt ok taking the first step. I know I needed help for years. I do not know what to do with the sister situation. I am still very low. But if anyone else is feeling low or suicidal. If this quiet, socially anxious weirdo like me can do it, anyone of you can I rung a support group\n",
      "Statement 44: well, i do not even know how to start this. I am so confused and lonely. just as info I am a 17 y/o female.i have no idea if i even have depression but reading all of your stories, i recognize myself in most of them so i guess I am one of you. I have been experiencing extreme self-hatred for the past 5 years, triggered by a tragic event in my life and then developing rapidly. its like my thoughts are my biggest enemy and I am constantly bringing myself down for the things i do and the way i look.generally, i do not share personal thoughts with people, its actually the first time i am speaking about this. i just ignored it but lately its been getting so troublesome i cannot sleep and I am always in a bad mood. suicidal thoughts have been coming up as well which scares me a lot.furthermore, i just feel apathy towards everything and everyone. yesterday i got my first job offer and i just felt numb. i know I am not worthy and i do not deserve it so i just did not tell anyone about it even if it was an achievement. same thing with good grades, i just do not care anymore. guilt has also been my best friend throughout these years. something happens and then i just put the guilt on myself. its like i know it straightaway even before considering the situation.its just getting worse after every day and i am really lost. thanks for reading and sorry i bothered you with my thoughts. just another depressed buddy here\n",
      "Statement 45: Last year I got into music production and i quote it as the happiest year of my life.I was working on music 6 hours a day (at least). I once managed to pull off working for 12 hours.I really loved what I was doing , but this year..its different I do not know how.I am just lost , I can barely work for 2 hours and worst thing is games are back into my life. In 2020 everything that could possibly happen that is good to me has happend. I lost all my weight and got on some serious muscles all by working from home. I had such a mentality for work that year , it was ahead of everything.Back then I loved music so much I managed to not play games at all , I once did not boot up anything for 2 weeks straight. Now , I play games almost everyday (for 2 hours or so) and the worst thing is this fucking game Hearts of Iron 4 got me hooked onto it but it did not made me political. I just remember the days when I was a fat piece of shit and was playing that game in 2016 and I get anxious about all of that coming back right at me.I even uninstalled the game few days ago in hopes of my work hours going up but it did no such thing.What I am trying to say is that I lost the working spirit and I do not know how , I am genuinely not a lazy person.There is a person in my life that is stressing me a lot , I think about it everyday and it does bother me.I do not want to talk about it but I do want to meantion it , I was mad at the same person last year but I was still managing to work very hard.I am not suicidal nor do I think about it , just trapped in an endless loop of anger towards myself.Feel like I am in a minefield , that I have to look at every single step I take.There is something to meantion though , I have quit drinking coffee and any unhealthy drinks (energy drinks , coca cola , pepsi and alike) for 6 months now.Those drinks gave me the ability to stay up at night and make music , which was perfect because every producer encourages that , its just like magic when you work on music while your brain is half dead.But now I cannot make it past 10 , what is interesting is that I can play games untill 1 in the morning but not make music and that is 1 of the many reasons I hate myself. What is wrong with me\n",
      "Statement 46: The memories I suppressed for so long suddenly triggered today. I remembered how I used to feel like I was trapped in my own world and how i was suicidal in junior school, at around age 10. I remember how my mum used to go into rage at mistakes i would make or me being annoying. I remembered how mum would tell me to put my arm out for her to hit me, and if i pulled my arm back in fear, she would threaten to hit me even harder. I was really fucked up back then. Every other night Id think about running away, never having to face anyone who would hurt me or berate me or make fun of me like my classmates and teachers at school would or like my mum would at home. I think today was the day my old self that i had abandoned to heal finally came back to haunt me. Just needed to write this down. I just needed to write this down\n",
      "Statement 47: So introduction I guess.. my name is Michael and I am 20 yo. I live in Slovakia though I would be surprised if anybody knew where that is located. And I am struggling with..I do not know maybe deppresion?The problems started like long time ago back when I was still a child. My mum hated the fuck out of my dad and for some reason my dad hated her too. My dad is like the typical stereotype guy who thinks that woman should be in kitchen taking care of her husband. He was and still is to be honest addicted to alcohol. I remember when I was a child and my mum had to go away for a couple of days that everytime my dad stepped through front door I prayed to god because I was always afraid that he arrives drunk again. I was so genuinely happy when he did not and I always hid in my closet when he did. In school I was not very popular. I am the kind of guy who thinks that if you have the means, if you have the option and ability to help somebody you should by all means do that. Of course people tend to take advantage of that. Everytime they needed something I would do it eventhough if it meant that I had to spent 4 hours doing their homework or writing an essay. Of course I was bullied too when they did not need me because why the fuck not right I deserved that. I did not have a single true friend everybody I considered to be my friends they insulted me and humilliated me most of the time and I did not like it. I was so alone that I just decided that I had to have a friend. And that is when my schizophrenia probably started.I made myself a friend. He is called Martin Ladec I even created him a facebook account so I could chat with him because I had always wanted to have friend that I could chat with on facebook. Everytime I was alone I talked to him. My imaginary best friend. It all started like nothing too serious every conversation I had with him always played in my head like I only imagined that I was talking to him because I had known that he was not real. But then I started talking out loud to him.. It just went like this I do not really know how to explain it properly. I just sat on the ground and started crying and telling him how I was feeling but after I was done talking I got up smiled at the spot where I had been crying and tried to reassure the spot you know like if I was Martin cheering up Michael. After some time I got better but then I started hearing voices it was around 8th or 9th grade. They were telling me how pitiful I was, that I should kill myself that everybody hated me. I started to feel really deppressed and it was not helping when the actual people were telling me how pitiful I am and how they hated me. So at the end of elementary school my mind was shattered like glass into so many parts. Part that wants to kill me, other part who argues with the first part and telling me to live, Martin and myself.Then the high school came and I found new friends..like true friends. I liked them so much and they seemed to like me too. There was this particular guy that I enjoyed spending my time with we had so much in common. He loved the same type of music I did, movies, TV series and so on. Of course I had fallen in love with him. I did not even realized that I was gay but when I did I just went along with it. But I loved and still I love him so much..I guess I was really obsessed with him. I was jealous everytime he went out with somebody else ( of course i did not tell him I am not dumb I knew it would ruin everything) I was thinking of him everytime I went to bed and everytime I woke up. He had a best friend, our classmate, and the three of us started hanging out a lot. It got to a point when we had like really deep shit conversation and I remember that the other guy ( not the one I love ) told me ( because he could see that I had been struggling ) : ,,The stupidest thing that a person can do when he has some problems is that he never tells anyone about those problems. Talk about it.\" and then the guy I loved said : ,,We are telling everything to each other. Tell us.\" And I told them because I believed in them. I told them about the voices and about Martin and everything. It went fine it seemed they believed me but of course.. shit had to get worse. ( for the sake of this the guy I love is : T and his best friend is : S)At one point I do not know what happened but S accused me of lying. He said that nothing that happened to me never really happened to me and that I like the attention I am getting because of that and I just want people to pity me. He told other guys in my class and so I became the guy who is constantly lying, exaggerating and deppressed. I never stopped talking to them though. I understood that this shit is really hard to believe. T was still my number 1 friend because he seemed that he still believed me. I started to love him even more. I have always had money I did not even know how. From insurance, when my grandma and aunt died and what they left me. So always when I needed or wanted something I had it. And he did not have the luck he had like no money. Like he was not poor or anything but when he wanted Converse for example he could not afford. And I felt selfish because I had the money and he did not so I felt like it would be really selfish of me not to buy things for him. I bought him those. And trousers. And jackets. And games on ps4 ( which by the waay I bought just so I could play with him ). I remember that once he told me how much he dreamed of getting a new computer but his mum did not let him have it. So I literally started building my own new pc for 600 eventhough the one I currently had was completely fine. The old one I had cost me around 500. I told I am that I had built myself a new pc so I can give him my old one. For free. And I did. I literally spent on him around 600 because I gave him my monitor because he did not have one and I had to buy myself a new one. And I still was so happy when I bought those things for him and gave those things to him. I loved him so much like this is probably the true love you know.Then last year came and it all went to shit. It was my last year on my school and we had a party the entire class after Stukova. ( Stukova is like the Ball you have in last year of high school. After Stukova you have Dozvuky where all students just drink a lot ). S dated my classmate but they broke up before Dozvuky. I was really good friend with S' ex at that time. I am not going to explain what happened exactly this post is long enough even without those details but basically S \" fooled around \" with two girls. Two girls his ex hated the most. She was really sad and I was talking to her the entire time. After Dozvuky and everything I met him and he told me that I really fucked up. He told me that I disgust him and if I feel hurt that I deserve it. He blamed me for something I did not do. He did not want me to explain to him and he stopped talking to me. In the same week every guy from our class stopped talking to me including T and I realized that he told them his version and they all feel same as him about me. It could not come in worse moment. I was feeling during this time deppressed a lot. I had a friend ( M ) She was like my best friend after S and T. She knew that I was gay and she knew that I loved T. Still she fooled around with him when we had parties. When I was there. 3 times. Everytime she did it she told me that she was sorry and promised me she would never do it again. And she did it two more times. One time i was in the same bed as T and M and they started making out next to me. It was the worst feeling ever because I loved him so much and she knew and still she did it. I was heartbroken and defeated and I started cutting myself. And then S dumped me because of the misunderstanding and every guy dumped me and I was alone again. Fortunately I am not that stupid and I realized that I coudln't continue like this. I am proud of myself that I realized that I need professional help because most people cannot do it.So I started looking for a psychologist at first.Someone to talk to. I tried 9 different ones. And they all told me the same thing. Only time can help. I did the Rorschach test numerous times and still they were not able to find anything wrong with me eventhough my every goddamn answer was really deppressing, negative and not positive at all. I cut myself. I hear voices telling me that I should kill myself or the ones that hurt me. I created an imaginary friend. For fuck sake even I as a patient was able to realize that something is a bit fucking fishy about me. They did not help. One psychologist even tried to touch my thigh. So that much for proffessional help. So I started looking for a psychiatrist . I told him the same story and he gave me pills. Arisppa. It did not help. The best part is that I told him that I had told S about my voices and stuff and how I hurt felt when he did not believe me and accused me of being a drama queen and guess what did the fucking psychiatrist asked? \" Michael, are you telling me the truth? Do you really hear the voices or have you made this all up just to skip school or be different? To let people pity you?\" Is this even possible in modern world? in which fucking dimension would sane psychiatrist ask such a dumb question? I snapped and I started laughing hysterically after that. I was laughing at my place for good 3 hours and then I started crying. And laughing after that. Some people just insult those who kill themselves and say that it is selfish decision. I totally understand suicide now. I have problems I accept that. I wanted help I desperatelly needed help but everything is against me. In this world if you are not selfish bastard you cannot be happy. This world is not made for people like me. it is really easy to say that \" get some help\" because apparently nobody can help. Like I do not even know if anybody is going to read this or not. But if some lost sould read this entire novel to the end just wanted to let you know that do not worry I promise I WILL NOT kill myself. I tried sure but I am not strong enough to do that. Besides my paranoid me thinks that it would make other guys happy and I do not want to give them this satisfaction.Honestly I do not know what I expected from this. I do not know if I want your help because I know you cannot help me. But I tried everything. Psychologists, psychiatrists, telling friends, group therapies, fucking taiwan mantras to calm my mind, tropical teas and herbs to soothe my mind. Nothing worked so I just thought fuck it let us give it a shot. Maybe miracle will happen. do not know what else to do so I just leave it up here\n",
      "Statement 48: I am a 15M. I smoke weed as a way to cope with my anxiety and depression that gets worse at night. I also use it as a way to fall asleep easier. My dad found my weed last night and told me he was dissappointed, he said it is not a good way to deal with things. He said he cannot force me what to do or what not to do, but he trusted me enough and handed it back to me. I do not know what to feel about that. Right now, my dad is also having troubles with my mom, and sadly my little sister got stuck in the crossfire. My dad is barely talking to anyone like he used to. He does this very often. When he gets angry, he shuts himself off and does not talk to anyone. He probably has a mental illness of some sort, he is a very complex person. My mom once told him to go see a psychiatrist but he refused to because that is just how he is. He does not have a good relationship with his own father, which might be a because or something.I also recently got diagnosed with mild depression and anxiety and got prescribed with Lexapro. I have been taking them for a week now. My mother is the only person I can always talk to but I cannot tell her about the weed thing because I got caught before in school and she knew. I want to explain to my dad about everything but knowing that he is the person that he is, a part of me also does not want to open up to him. he is a sensitive person, something so slight can trigger him to the point of shutting himself off from his family. Smoking weed has always been that barrier between me appreciating life and jumping off a cliff. I do not know if I should continue smoking or not, I feel so guilty if l smoke because I know my dad is probably stressed about this situation also. I am pretty well known in my city, I know alot of people but that does not help either. I cannot trust anyone at all. I have only 2 real friends, my best friend and his girlfriend. I am so young, I do not know why I am feeling this way, it is so overwhelming. I just want to sleep all day and never wake up. I want to kill myself but in a way that noone would be sad about. I know there is people that care about me. My mom does. My dad does. My friends do. But when you are suicidal, nothing really even matter anymore. I feel like I cannot take this. it is so overwhelming. I just want someone to read this and help me understand myself better because I barely know myself anymore. I hope someone reads this to the very end\n",
      "Statement 49: I have always hated myself throught my 17 years being here. but i never really know if I am actually sad as fuck all the time or doing it for attention... hearing everyone talking about their past and traumas makes me feel like i honestly have no right to be suicidal and sad. I am honestly going crazy trying not to end it all here. all of my pillars of support are in different schools and i barely see them as much as i used to.. now i spend my days in my own school barely talking to anyone and leaving straightaway every time my teacher dismisses us. yea sure i have a boyfriend and i know that i can always talk to him but i still feel so alone. am i bad person? am i faking it..?\n",
      "Statement 50: \"you have been procrastinating from more than a year you piece of shit! And now that you are responsibilities r buttfucking you, you r tryna blame lockdown, covid and isolation for this huh? How big of a coward you are, you deserve to die. Nah wait, you thinking about suicide from a few months? you coward tryna exit you are problems like that? Ever thought how you are family will feel? Oh you r such a selfish coward, you definitely deserve to die. I think you were born evil, an absolute madman, go die you fucking piece of trash, you will die regardless. And now you posting this paragraph on Reddit to get some sympathy huh? 17 year olds have nothing to be depressed about, it is all in you are head. you r responsible for every bad thing that is happening, yes I said you! Been isolating yourself from a year, who needs friends huh? Just go lock yourself in the bedroom again and pretend to be good around others. you told you are parents but they do not care, no one cares for you, you ugly fat motherfucker, no girl will ever like to be with you. you deserve to die. Just fuckin' die and end this shit once and for all. \"I honestly do not want any sympathy at this point. Ik I am responsible for everything, I have been responsible for everything that has went wrong with me. guilt and shame r going to kill me someday, I guess that day is coming soon. I am sorry that I made you read such a long paragraph that does not even matter(does not even make sense, I am just insane. No, I am just a dramatic piece of shit) . I really hope you all have a nice day ahead. To all the people suffering with any type of mental illness, I hope God gives you the strength to survive through it, I believe you r strong enough. Once again, I am extremely sorry for my rant. I have just gone insane maybe(nah tryna push my responsibilities once again). Just downvote this post. Peace Just Fuckin' Die\n"
